    "# Classification with XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "> This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental idea behind XGBoost—boosted learners. Once you understand how XGBoost works, you'll apply it to solve a common classification problem found in industry - predicting whether a customer will stop being a customer at some point in the future. This is the Summary of lecture \"Extreme Gradient Boosting with XGBoost\", via datacamp.\n",

This is a typical setup for a churn prediction problem. To do this, you'll split the data into training and test sets, fit a small xgboost model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set by computing its accuracy."
