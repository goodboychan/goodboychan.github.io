You are going to create a random tensor of sizes 3 by 3 and set it to variable `your_first_tensor`. Then, you will need to print it. Finally, calculate its size in variable `tensor_size` and print its value."

Some important matrices are matrices of ones (where each entry is set to 1) and the identity matrix (where the diagonal is set to 1 while all other values are 0). The identity matrix is very important in linear algebra: any matrix multiplied with identity matrix is simply the original matrix.\n",
