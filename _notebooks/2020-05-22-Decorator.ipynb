      "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\n",
      "Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the\n",
      "vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,\n",
      "though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering\n",
      "along with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a\n",
      "coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.\n",
      "It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a\n",
      "man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome\n",
      "features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even\n",
      "at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric\n",
      "current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive\n",
      "in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,\n",
      "who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went\n",
      "slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the\n",
      "lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was\n",
      "one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about\n",
      "when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had\n",
      "something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an\n",
      "oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface\n",
      "of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank\n",
      "somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument\n",
      "(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of\n",
      "shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail\n",
      "figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls\n",
      "which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face\n",
      "naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor\n",
      "blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in\n",
      "the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into\n",
      "spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there\n",
      "seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered\n",
      "everywhere. The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding\n",
      "corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER\n",
      "IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into\n",
      "Winston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,\n",
      "flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the\n",
      "single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between\n",
      "the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again\n",
      "with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's\n",
      "windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police\n",
      "mattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away\n",
      "about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The\n",
      "telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston\n",
      "made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,\n",
      "moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal\n",
      "plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course\n",
      "no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How\n",
      "often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual\n",
      "wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all\n",
      "the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted\n",
      "to. You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in the\n",
      "assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in\n",
      "darkness, every movement scrutinized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he\n",
      "well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of\n",
      "Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.\n",
      "This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--this was London, chief\n",
      "city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of\n",
      "Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him\n",
      "whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these\n",
      "vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with\n",
      "baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs\n",
      "with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?\n",
      "And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the\n",
      "willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the\n",
      "bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies\n",
      "of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not\n",
      "remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit\n",
      "tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official\n",
      "language of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology see\n",
      "Appendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It\n",
      "was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring\n",
      "up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston\n",
      "stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in\n",
      "elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  WAR IS PEACE\n",
      "  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\n",
      "  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above\n",
      "ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London\n",
      "there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So\n",
      "completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof\n",
      "of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They\n",
      "were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus\n",
      "of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself\n",
      "with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of\n",
      "Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which\n",
      "maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible\n",
      "for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,\n",
      "and Miniplenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows\n",
      "in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor\n",
      "within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except\n",
      "on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of\n",
      "barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even\n",
      "the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced\n",
      "guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the\n",
      "expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing\n",
      "the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving\n",
      "the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the\n",
      "canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except\n",
      "a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's\n",
      "breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid\n",
      "with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily\n",
      "smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,\n",
      "nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The\n",
      "stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the\n",
      "sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The\n",
      "next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world\n",
      "began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet\n",
      "marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the\n",
      "tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful.\n",
      "He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood\n",
      "to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a\n",
      "penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a\n",
      "red back and a marbled cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual\n",
      "position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where\n",
      "it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the\n",
      "window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston\n",
      "was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been\n",
      "intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well\n",
      "back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so\n",
      "far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed\n",
      "in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual\n",
      "geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now\n",
      "about to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of\n",
      "the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper,\n",
      "a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for\n",
      "at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much\n",
      "older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little\n",
      "junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not\n",
      "now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire\n",
      "to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops\n",
      "('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not\n",
      "strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and\n",
      "razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He\n",
      "had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside\n",
      "and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious\n",
      "of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home\n",
      "in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising\n",
      "possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal\n",
      "(nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected\n",
      "it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least\n",
      "by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into\n",
      "the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic\n",
      "instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one,\n",
      "furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the\n",
      "beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead\n",
      "of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing\n",
      "by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything\n",
      "into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present\n",
      "purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a\n",
      "second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the\n",
      "decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   April 4th, 1984.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To\n",
      "begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It\n",
      "must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was\n",
      "thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but\n",
      "it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?\n",
      "For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the\n",
      "doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the\n",
      "Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude of what he had\n",
      "undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It\n",
      "was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present,\n",
      "in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it,\n",
      "and his predicament would be meaningless.\n",
      "\n",

      "atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general\n",
      "clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked\n",
      "nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always\n",

      "adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and\n",
      "nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression\n",

      "uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever\n",
      "she was anywhere near him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and\n",

      "idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people\n",
      "round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member\n",
      "approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,\n",
      "humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a\n",
      "certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on\n",
      "his nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously\n",
      "civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such\n",
      "terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his\n",
      "snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many\n",
      "years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued\n",
      "by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's\n",
      "physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps\n",
      "not even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was\n",
      "not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,\n",
      "perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but\n",
      "simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a\n",

      "\n",
      "As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had\n",
      "flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the\n",
      "audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and\n",
      "disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago\n",
      "(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading\n",
      "figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and\n",
      "then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned\n",
      "to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes\n",
      "of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in\n",
      "which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor,\n",
      "the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against\n",
      "the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,\n",
      "sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still\n",
      "alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,\n",
      "under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it was\n",
      "occasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of\n",
      "Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face,\n",
      "with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--a\n",
      "clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile\n",
      "silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles\n",
      "was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a\n",
      "sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack\n",
      "upon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse that\n",
      "a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible\n",
      "enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less\n",
      "level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big\n",
      "Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding\n",
      "the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom\n",
      "of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought,\n",
      "he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and all\n",
      "this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the\n",
      "habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak\n",
      "words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally\n",
      "use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to\n",
      "the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on\n",
      "the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--row\n",
      "after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam\n",
      "up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others\n",
      "exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the\n",
      "background to Goldstein's bleating voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable\n",
      "exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.\n",
      "The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power\n",
      "of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,\n",
      "the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger\n",
      "automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia\n",
      "or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was\n",
      "generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although\n",
      "Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a\n",
      "thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,\n",
      "in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the\n",
      "general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,\n",
      "his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes\n",
      "waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs\n",
      "acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.\n",
      "He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of\n",
      "conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its\n",
      "name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible\n",
      "book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author\n",
      "and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a\n",
      "title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew\n",
      "of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor\n",
      "THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if\n",
      "there was a way of avoiding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and\n",
      "down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort\n",
      "to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little\n",
      "sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and\n",
      "shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.\n",
      "He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and\n",
      "quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The\n",
      "dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!'\n",
      "and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the\n",
      "screen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued\n",
      "inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the\n",
      "others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The\n",
      "horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to\n",
      "act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining\n",
      "in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous\n",
      "ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash\n",
      "faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of\n",
      "people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into\n",
      "a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an\n",
      "abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to\n",
      "another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred\n",
      "was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against\n",
      "Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his\n",
      "heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian\n",
      "of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he\n",
      "was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein\n",
      "seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big\n",
      "Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an\n",
      "invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes\n",
      "of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and\n",
      "the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister\n",
      "enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure\n",
      "of civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that\n",
      "by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one\n",
      "wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded\n",
      "in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired\n",
      "girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.\n",
      "He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked\n",
      "to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would\n",
      "ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before,\n",
      "moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because\n",
      "she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with\n",
      "her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which\n",
      "seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious\n",
      "scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual\n",
      "sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.\n",
      "Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed\n",
      "to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and\n",
      "seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the\n",
      "people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But\n",
      "in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the\n",
      "hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,\n",
      "black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that\n",
      "it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.\n",
      "It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are\n",
      "uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but\n",
      "restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big\n",
      "Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood\n",
      "out in bold capitals:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  WAR IS PEACE\n",
      "  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\n",
      "  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the\n",
      "screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was\n",
      "too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung\n",
      "herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a\n",
      "tremulous murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her arms\n",
      "towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent\n",
      "that she was uttering a prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,\n",
      "rhythmical chant of 'B-B!...B-B!'--over and over again, very slowly, with a\n",
      "long pause between the first 'B' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,\n",
      "somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the\n",
      "stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as\n",
      "thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in\n",
      "moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom\n",
      "and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,\n",
      "a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.\n",
      "Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could\n",
      "not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of\n",
      "'B-B!...B-B!' always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the\n",
      "rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to\n",
      "control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive\n",
      "reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the\n",
      "expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was\n",
      "exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,\n",
      "it did happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken\n",
      "off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with\n",
      "his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when\n",
      "their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, he\n",
      "KNEW!--that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable\n",
      "message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the\n",
      "thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'I am\n",
      "with you,' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely what you\n",
      "are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.\n",
      "But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligence\n",
      "was gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such\n",
      "incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him\n",
      "the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the\n",
      "Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after\n",
      "all--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite\n",
      "of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the\n",
      "Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days\n",
      "not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything\n",
      "or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory\n",
      "walls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand\n",
      "which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all\n",
      "guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his\n",
      "cubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their\n",
      "momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably\n",
      "dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two\n",
      "seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of\n",
      "the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in\n",
      "which one had to live.\n",

      "horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as\n",

      "and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the\n",

      "hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship\n",
      "of Big Brother--it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their\n",
      "ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against\n",
      "foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal\n",
      "for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with\n",

      "The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen\n",

      "darkness.' It was said very quietly, almost casually--a statement, not a\n",
      "command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the\n",
      "time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was\n",
      "only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He\n",
      "could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that\n",
      "he had seen O'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had\n",
      "first identified the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the identification\n",
      "existed. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston had never been able to feel sure--even after this morning's flash\n",
      "of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friend\n",
      "or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of\n",
      "understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.\n",
      "'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' he had said.\n",
      "Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it\n",
      "would come true.\n",

      "one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable\n",

      "a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the\n",

      "loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and\n",
      "because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a\n",
      "conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he\n",
      "saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but\n",
      "no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to\n",

      "the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was\n",
      "looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain\n",
      "whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he\n",
      "called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a\n",
      "foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged\n",
      "hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were\n",
      "swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense\n",
      "masses like women's hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight,\n",
      "there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the\n",
      "pools under the willow trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With\n",
      "what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them\n",
      "disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire\n",
      "in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant\n",
      "was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.\n",
      "With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture,\n",
      "a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the\n",
      "Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid\n",

      "a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually,\n",
      "and a suit of pyjamas was 600--and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of\n",
      "shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in\n",
      "three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit\n",
      "which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs\n",
      "so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back\n",
      "and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of\n",

      "wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper\n",
      "during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into\n",
      "the dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult.\n",
      "Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external\n",
      "records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost\n",
      "its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not\n",
      "happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to\n",
      "recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you\n",
      "could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of\n",
      "countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One,\n",

      "raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time\n",

      "hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round\n",
      "a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied\n",
      "his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. His\n",

      "because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you\n",

      "in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the\n",
      "whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--in\n",
      "reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was\n",

      "enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,' he said almost\n",
      "sadly. 'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak. I've read\n",
      "some of those pieces that you write in \"The Times\" occasionally. They're\n",
      "good enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stick\n",
      "to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning.\n",
      "You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that\n",
      "Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller\n",
      "every year?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not\n",
      "trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of the\n",
      "dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of\n",
      "thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible,\n",
      "because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that\n",
      "can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning\n",
      "rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.\n",
      "Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point. But the\n",
      "process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year\n",
      "fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little\n",
      "smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or excuse for committing\n",
      "thoughtcrime. It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control.\n",
      "But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution will\n",
      "be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc\n",
      "is Newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. 'Has it ever\n",
      "occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a\n",
      "single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation\n",
      "as we are having now?'\n",

      "\n",
      "It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except the proles,' but he\n",
      "checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in\n",
      "some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. 'By 2050--earlier,\n",
      "probably--all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole\n",
      "literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare,\n",
      "Milton, Byron--they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed\n",
      "into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory\n",
      "of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change.\n",
      "Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like \"freedom is\n",
      "slavery\" when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate\n",
      "of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we\n",
      "understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think.\n",
      "Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.'\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will\n",
      "be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too\n",
      "plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear.\n",
      "It is written in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways\n",
      "in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left the man\n",
      "with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young\n",
      "woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back\n",
      "to Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with\n",
      "everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remark\n",
      "as 'I think you're so right, I do so agree with you', uttered in a youthful\n",
      "and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an\n",
      "instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight,\n",
      "though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post\n",
      "in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular\n",
      "throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and\n",
      "because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the\n",
      "light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was\n",
      "slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of\n",
      "his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just\n",
      "once Winston caught a phrase--'complete and final elimination of\n",
      "Goldsteinism'--jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece,\n",
      "like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a\n",
      "quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the\n",
      "man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.\n",
      "He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against\n",
      "thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the\n",
      "atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the\n",
      "heroes on the Malabar front--it made no difference. Whatever it was, you\n",
      "could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.\n",
      "As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down,\n",
      "Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but\n",
      "some kind of dummy. It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was\n",
      "his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but\n",
      "it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in\n",
      "unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was\n",
      "tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other table\n",
      "quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There is a word in Newspeak,' said Syme, 'I don't know whether you know\n",
      "it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting words\n",
      "that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse,\n",
      "applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thought\n",
      "it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him\n",
      "and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a\n",
      "thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something\n",
      "subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion,\n",
      "aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was\n",
      "unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big\n",
      "Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with\n",
      "sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of\n",
      "information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint\n",
      "air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have\n",
      "been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut\n",
      "Tree Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an\n",
      "unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the place\n",
      "was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been\n",
      "used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself,\n",
      "it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme's\n",
      "fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme\n",
      "grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secret\n",
      "opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So would\n",
      "anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not\n",
      "enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'that bloody fool'.\n",
      "Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading\n",
      "his way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a\n",
      "froglike face. At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at\n",
      "neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole\n",
      "appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although\n",
      "he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to\n",
      "think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red\n",
      "neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture of\n",
      "dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did,\n",
      "indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other\n",
      "physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both\n",
      "with a cheery 'Hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off an\n",
      "intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.\n",
      "His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Centre you\n",
      "could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of\n",
      "the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a\n",
      "long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his\n",
      "fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said Parsons, nudging\n",
      "Winston. 'Keenness, eh? What's that you've got there, old boy? Something\n",
      "a bit too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'm\n",
      "chasing you. It's that sub you forgot to give me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which sub is that?' said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About\n",
      "a quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions,\n",
      "which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "'For Hate Week. You know--the house-by-house fund. I'm treasurer for our\n",
      "block. We're making an all-out effort--going to put on a tremendous show.\n",
      "I tell you, it won't be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have the\n",
      "biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons\n",
      "entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'By the way, old boy,' he said. 'I hear that little beggar of mine let fly\n",
      "at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good dressing-down for it.\n",
      "In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does it again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,' said\n",
      "Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, well--what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it?\n",
      "Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness!\n",
      "All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. D'you know what\n",
      "that little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike\n",
      "out Berkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off\n",
      "from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. They\n",
      "kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when\n",
      "they got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What did they do that for?' said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsons\n",
      "went on triumphantly:\n",
      "\n",
      "'My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent--might have been dropped\n",
      "by parachute, for instance. But here's the point, old boy. What do you\n",
      "think put her on to him in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a\n",
      "funny kind of shoes--said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that\n",
      "before. So the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipper\n",
      "of seven, eh?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What happened to the man?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, that I couldn't say, of course. But I wouldn't be altogether surprised\n",
      "if----' Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue\n",
      "for the explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good,' said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed Winston dutifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I mean to say, there is a war on,' said Parsons.\n",
      "\n",
      "As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the\n",
      "telescreen just above their heads. However, it was not the proclamation of\n",
      "a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry\n",
      "of Plenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'Attention, comrades! We have\n",
      "glorious news for you. We have won the battle for production! Returns now\n",
      "completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the\n",
      "standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past\n",
      "year. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous\n",
      "demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and\n",
      "paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big\n",
      "Brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed\n",
      "upon us. Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs----'\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. It had been a\n",
      "favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention\n",
      "caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity,\n",
      "a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was\n",
      "aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged\n",
      "out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.\n",
      "With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to\n",
      "fill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he\n",
      "held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and\n",
      "he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to\n",
      "the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the\n",
      "telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank\n",
      "Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And\n",
      "only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was\n",
      "to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could\n",
      "swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons\n",
      "swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature\n",
      "at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious\n",
      "desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that\n",
      "last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too--in some more\n",
      "complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONE\n",
      "in the possession of a memory?\n",
      "\n",
      "The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As\n",
      "compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses,\n",
      "more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,\n",
      "more books, more babies--more of everything except disease, crime, and\n",
      "insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was\n",
      "whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up\n",
      "his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across\n",
      "the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated\n",
      "resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like\n",
      "this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen.\n",
      "A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of\n",
      "innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close\n",
      "together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays,\n",
      "coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a\n",
      "sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and\n",
      "dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort\n",
      "of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had\n",
      "a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly\n",
      "different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never\n",
      "been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that\n",
      "were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety,\n",
      "rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces,\n",
      "bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes\n",
      "insufficient--nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though,\n",
      "of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this\n",
      "was NOT the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the\n",
      "discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness\n",
      "of one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty\n",
      "soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil\n",
      "tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind\n",
      "of ancestral memory that things had once been different?\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and would\n",
      "still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue\n",
      "overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small,\n",
      "curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes\n",
      "darting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought\n",
      "Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type\n",
      "set up by the Party as an ideal--tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed\n",
      "maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree--existed and even\n",
      "predominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people\n",
      "in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curious how that\n",
      "beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing\n",
      "stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and\n",
      "fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to\n",
      "flourish best under the dominion of the Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call\n",
      "and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the\n",
      "bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Ministry of Plenty's certainly done a good job this year,' he said\n",
      "with a knowing shake of his head. 'By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose\n",
      "you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not one,' said Winston. 'I've been using the same blade for six weeks\n",
      "myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, well--just thought I'd ask you, old boy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sorry,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the\n",
      "Ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For some\n",
      "reason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her\n",
      "wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those\n",
      "children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would\n",
      "be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O'Brien\n",
      "would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.\n",
      "The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.\n",
      "The little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine\n",
      "corridors of Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl\n",
      "with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department--she would never be\n",
      "vaporized either. It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would\n",
      "survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for\n",
      "survival, it was not easy to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The\n",
      "girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. It\n",
      "was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but\n",
      "with curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sweat started out on Winston's backbone. A horrible pang of terror\n",
      "went through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging\n",
      "uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following him\n",
      "about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at\n",

      "was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity\n",
      "of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there\n",
      "with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It was\n",
      "extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then\n",
      "he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should\n",

      "They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performance\n",
      "continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not\n",
      "impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something\n",
      "which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had\n",
      "two names for it. One was 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty to\n",

      "They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the\n",
      "enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various\n",
      "trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother\n",
      "which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage\n",

      "Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them\n",
      "in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered the sort of terrified fascination\n",

      "far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great\n",
      "figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the\n",

      "blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that\n",
      "of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed\n",
      "with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had\n",
      "once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end.\n",
      "They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise\n",
      "even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sitting\n",
      "in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the\n",
      "speciality of the cafe. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance\n",
      "had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist,\n",
      "whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and\n",
      "during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were\n",
      "appearing in The Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier\n",
      "manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a\n",
      "rehashing of the ancient themes--slum tenements, starving children, street\n",
      "battles, capitalists in top hats--even on the barricades the capitalists\n",
      "still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort to\n",
      "get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy\n",
      "grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one\n",
      "time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging,\n",
      "sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking\n",
      "up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now remember how he\n",
      "had come to be in the cafe at such a time. The place was almost empty. A\n",
      "tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their\n",
      "corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought\n",
      "fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with\n",
      "the pieces set out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute\n",
      "in all, something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they were\n",
      "playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came into\n",
      "it--but it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked,\n",
      "braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note. And\n",
      "then a voice from the telescreen was singing:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Under the spreading chestnut tree\n",
      "  I sold you and you sold me:\n",
      "  There lie they, and here lie we\n",
      "  Under the spreading chestnut tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford's\n",
      "ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first\n",
      "time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing\n",
      "AT WHAT he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they had\n",
      "engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At\n",
      "their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with\n",
      "a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded\n",
      "in the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after\n",
      "this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just\n",
      "flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment\n",
      "of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then\n",
      "forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.\n",
      "It was a half-page torn out of 'The Times' of about ten years earlier--the\n",
      "top half of the page, so that it included the date--and it contained a\n",
      "photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent\n",
      "in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was\n",
      "no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the\n",
      "bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that\n",
      "date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield\n",
      "in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with\n",
      "members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important\n",
      "military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced\n",
      "to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless\n",
      "other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the\n",
      "confessions were lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston\n",
      "had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had\n",
      "actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was\n",
      "concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil\n",
      "bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory.\n",
      "It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have\n",
      "been published to the world and its significance made known.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph\n",
      "was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper.\n",
      "Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of\n",
      "view of the telescreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as\n",
      "to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face\n",
      "expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be\n",
      "controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your\n",
      "heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let\n",
      "what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the\n",
      "fear that some accident--a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for\n",
      "instance--would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped\n",
      "the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers.\n",
      "Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was ten--eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that\n",
      "photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers\n",
      "seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself,\n",
      "as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party's hold\n",
      "upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which\n",
      "existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?\n",
      "\n",
      "But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes,\n",
      "the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he\n",
      "made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must\n",
      "have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed\n",
      "their country. Since then there had been other changes--two, three,\n",
      "he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been\n",
      "rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer\n",
      "had the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changed\n",
      "continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that\n",
      "he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken.\n",
      "The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the\n",
      "ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:\n",

      "\n",
      "   I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was\n",
      "a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it\n",
      "had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun;\n",
      "today, to believe that the past is unalterable. He might be ALONE in\n",
      "holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being\n",
      "a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also\n",
      "be wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of\n",
      "Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into\n",
      "his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon\n",
      "you--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your\n",
      "brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to\n",
      "deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that\n",
      "two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable\n",
      "that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their\n",
      "position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very\n",
      "existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The\n",
      "heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that\n",
      "they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.\n",
      "For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the\n",
      "force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past\n",
      "and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is\n",

      "But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. The face\n",
      "of O'Brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his\n",
      "mind. He knew, with more certainty than before, that O'Brien was on his\n",

      "Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning\n",
      "from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A\n",
      "young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a\n",
      "tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back\n",
      "again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like\n",
      "black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston,\n",
      "pointing excitedly to the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Steamer!' he yelled. 'Look out, guv'nor! Bang over'ead! Lay down quick!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Steamer' was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to\n",
      "rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were\n",
      "nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed\n",
      "to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance\n",
      "when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster\n",
      "than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar\n",
      "that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered\n",
      "on to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with\n",
      "fragments of glass from the nearest window.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the\n",
      "street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of\n",
      "plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There\n",
      "was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in\n",
      "the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he\n",
      "saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody\n",
      "stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned\n",
      "down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out\n",
      "of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of\n",
      "the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly\n",
      "twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs',\n",
      "they called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors,\n",
      "endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust,\n",
      "and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men\n",
      "were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a\n",
      "folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder.\n",
      "Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces,\n",
      "Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was\n",
      "obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few\n",
      "paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men\n",
      "were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point\n",
      "of blows.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number ending\n",
      "in seven ain't won for over fourteen months!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, it 'as, then!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years\n",
      "wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. An'\n",
      "I tell you, no number ending in seven----'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, a seven 'AS won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.\n",
      "Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in February--second week in February.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and white. An' I\n",

      "They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gone\n",
      "thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.\n",
      "The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public\n",
      "event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that\n",
      "there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal\n",
      "if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their\n",
      "folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was\n",
      "concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of\n",
      "intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole\n",
      "tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and\n",
      "lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery,\n",
      "which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed\n",
      "everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.\n",
      "Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being\n",
      "non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between\n",
      "one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that.\n",
      "When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at\n",
      "the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of\n",
      "faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling\n",
      "that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main\n",
      "thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of\n",
      "shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight\n",
      "of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers\n",
      "were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered\n",
      "where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next\n",
      "turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the\n",
      "blank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer's shop not\n",
      "far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of\n",
      "the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted\n",
      "over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but\n",
      "active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn,\n",
      "pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it\n",
      "occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had\n",
      "already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others\n",
      "like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of\n",
      "capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas\n",
      "had been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly\n",
      "been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few\n",
      "who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual\n",
      "surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful\n",
      "account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a\n",
      "prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into\n",
      "his diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold\n",
      "of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that\n",
      "old man and question him. He would say to him: 'Tell me about your life\n",
      "when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better\n",
      "than they are now, or were they worse?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the\n",
      "steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of course. As usual,\n",
      "there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their\n",
      "pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the\n",
      "patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not\n",
      "likely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous\n",
      "cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of\n",
      "voices dropped to about half its volume. Behind his back he could feel\n",
      "everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at\n",
      "the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty\n",
      "seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having\n",
      "some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young\n",
      "man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses\n",
      "in their hands, were watching the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?' said the old man, straightening his\n",
      "shoulders pugnaciously. 'You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the\n",
      "'ole bleeding boozer?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And what in hell's name IS a pint?' said the barman, leaning forward with\n",
      "the tips of his fingers on the counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "''Ark at 'im! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why,\n",
      "a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon.\n",
      "'Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre and half\n",
      "litre--that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelf in front\n",
      "of you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I likes a pint,' persisted the old man. 'You could 'a drawed me off a pint\n",
      "easy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,' said the\n",
      "barman, with a glance at the other customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry\n",
      "seemed to disappear. The old man's white-stubbled face had flushed pink. He\n",
      "turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught\n",
      "him gently by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'May I offer you a drink?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He\n",
      "appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls. 'Pint!' he added\n",
      "aggressively to the barman. 'Pint of wallop.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses\n",
      "which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink\n",
      "you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin,\n",
      "though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of\n",
      "darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun\n",
      "talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was forgotten for a\n",
      "moment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man\n",
      "could talk without fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but\n",
      "at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure\n",
      "of as soon as he came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "''E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old man as he settled down\n",
      "behind a glass. 'A 'alf litre ain't enough. It don't satisfy. And a 'ole\n",
      "litre's too much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the price.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,' said\n",
      "Winston tentatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and\n",
      "from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-room\n",
      "that he expected the changes to have occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The beer was better,' he said finally. 'And cheaper! When I was a young\n",
      "man, mild beer--wallop we used to call it--was fourpence a pint. That was\n",
      "before the war, of course.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which war was that?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and his\n",
      "shoulders straightened again. ''Ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth!'\n",
      "\n",
      "In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam's apple made a surprisingly rapid\n",
      "up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar and\n",
      "came back with two more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten\n",
      "his prejudice against drinking a full litre.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston. 'You must have been a\n",
      "grown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the old\n",
      "days, before the Revolution. People of my age don't really know anything\n",
      "about those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it says\n",
      "in the books may not be true. I should like your opinion on that. The\n",
      "history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different\n",
      "from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice,\n",
      "poverty worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass\n",
      "of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them\n",
      "hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left\n",
      "school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were\n",
      "a very few people, only a few thousands--the capitalists, they were\n",
      "called--who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was\n",
      "to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they\n",
      "rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne,\n",
      "they wore top hats----'\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man brightened suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Top 'ats!' he said. 'Funny you should mention 'em. The same thing come\n",
      "into my 'ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was jest thinking, I ain't seen\n",
      "a top 'at in years. Gorn right out, they 'ave. The last time I wore one\n",
      "was at my sister-in-law's funeral. And that was--well, I couldn't give you\n",
      "the date, but it must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 'ired\n",
      "for the occasion, you understand.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't very important about the top hats,' said Winston patiently.\n",
      "'The point is, these capitalists--they and a few lawyers and priests and\n",
      "so forth who lived on them--were the lords of the earth. Everything existed\n",
      "for their benefit. You--the ordinary people, the workers--were their\n",
      "slaves. They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you off to\n",
      "Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.\n",
      "They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine\n",
      "tails. You had to take your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist\n",
      "went about with a gang of lackeys who----'\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man brightened again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lackeys!' he said. 'Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long.\n",
      "Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that does. I recollect--oh, donkey's\n",
      "years ago--I used to sometimes go to 'Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to\n",
      "'ear the blokes making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews,\n",
      "Indians--all sorts there was. And there was one bloke--well, I couldn't\n",
      "give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was. 'E didn't 'alf\n",
      "give it 'em! \"Lackeys!\" 'e says, \"lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies of\n",

      "definitely called 'em 'yenas. Of course 'e was referring to the Labour\n",
      "Party, you understand.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said. 'Do you feel that you\n",
      "have more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated more\n",
      "like a human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at the\n",
      "top----'\n",

      "take off your cap when you passed them?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a quarter of his\n",

      "\n",
      "'Yes,' he said. 'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em. It showed\n",

      "Had to, as you might say.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Boat Race night--and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.\n",
      "Quite a gent, 'e was--dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kind\n",

      "fetched 'im one, only----'\n",
      "\n",
      "A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old man's memory was\n",
      "nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all day\n",
      "without getting any real information. The party histories might still be\n",
      "true, after a fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last\n",
      "attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said. 'What I'm trying to say\n",
      "is this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life\n",
      "before the Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.\n",
      "Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better\n",
      "than it is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live\n",
      "then or now?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He finished up his\n",
      "beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerant\n",
      "philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know what you expect me to say,' he said. 'You expect me to say as I'd\n",
      "sooner be young again. Most people'd say they'd sooner be young, if you\n",
      "arst 'em. You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young. When you\n",
      "get to my time of life you ain't never well. I suffer something wicked\n",
      "from my feet, and my bladder's jest terrible. Six and seven times a night\n",
      "it 'as me out of bed. On the other 'and, there's great advantages in being\n",
      "a old man. You ain't got the same worries. No truck with women, and that's\n",
      "a great thing. I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd\n",
      "credit it. Nor wanted to, what's more.'\n",

      "about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled\n",
      "rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra\n",
      "half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two\n",
      "gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out\n",
      "into the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the\n",
      "huge and simple question, 'Was life better before the Revolution than it\n",
      "is now?' would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect\n",
      "it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the\n",
      "ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They\n",
      "remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for\n",
      "a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, the\n",
      "swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant\n",
      "facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant,\n",
      "which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and\n",
      "written records were falsified--when that happened, the claim of the Party\n",
      "to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted,\n",
      "because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard\n",
      "against which it could be tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked\n",
      "up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed\n",
      "among dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three\n",
      "discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He\n",
      "seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop\n",
      "where he had bought the diary.\n",
      "\n",
      "A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to\n",
      "buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the\n",
      "place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander,\n",
      "his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely\n",
      "against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself\n",
      "by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it was\n",
      "nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. With the feeling that he\n",
      "would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he\n",
      "stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could plausibly say that\n",
      "he was trying to buy razor blades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an\n",
      "unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and\n",
      "bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick\n",
      "spectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and\n",
      "still black. His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact\n",
      "that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air\n",
      "of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or\n",
      "perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent\n",
      "less debased than that of the majority of proles.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately. 'You're the\n",
      "gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album. That was a beautiful\n",
      "bit of paper, that was. Cream-laid, it used to be called. There's been no\n",
      "paper like that made for--oh, I dare say fifty years.' He peered at Winston\n",
      "over the top of his spectacles. 'Is there anything special I can do for\n",
      "you? Or did you just want to look round?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was passing,' said Winston vaguely. 'I just looked in. I don't want\n",
      "anything in particular.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's just as well,' said the other, 'because I don't suppose I could have\n",
      "satisfied you.' He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand.\n",
      "'You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, the\n",
      "antique trade's just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock\n",
      "either. Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees. And\n",
      "of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I haven't seen a brass\n",
      "candlestick in years.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there\n",
      "was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The floorspace was very\n",
      "restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty\n",
      "picture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out\n",
      "chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even\n",
      "pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a\n",
      "small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends--lacquered\n",
      "snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like--which looked as though they might\n",
      "include something interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table his\n",
      "eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the\n",
      "lamplight, and he picked it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making\n",
      "almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in\n",
      "both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified\n",
      "by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that\n",
      "recalled a rose or a sea anemone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's coral, that is,' said the old man. 'It must have come from the\n",
      "Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasn't made\n",
      "less than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a beautiful thing,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively. 'But there's not\n",
      "many that'd say so nowadays.' He coughed. 'Now, if it so happened that you\n",
      "wanted to buy it, that'd cost you four dollars. I can remember when a thing\n",
      "like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was--well, I\n",
      "can't work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares about genuine\n",
      "antiques nowadays--even the few that's left?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing\n",
      "into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty\n",
      "as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different\n",
      "from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass\n",
      "that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its\n",
      "apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been\n",
      "intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately\n",
      "it did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising\n",
      "thing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and for\n",
      "that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had\n",
      "grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston\n",
      "realized that he would have accepted three or even two.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,' he\n",
      "said. 'There's not much in it. Just a few pieces. We'll do with a light if\n",
      "we're going upstairs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the\n",
      "steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did\n",
      "not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of\n",
      "chimney-pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as\n",
      "though the room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on\n",
      "the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair\n",
      "drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour\n",
      "face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying\n",
      "nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still\n",
      "on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We lived here till my wife died,' said the old man half apologetically.\n",
      "'I'm selling the furniture off by little and little. Now that's a beautiful\n",
      "mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it.\n",
      "But I dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and\n",
      "in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought\n",
      "flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to\n",
      "rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It\n",
      "was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but\n",
      "the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral\n",
      "memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in\n",
      "a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in\n",
      "the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with\n",
      "nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing\n",
      "of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah,' said the old man, 'I never had one of those things. Too expensive.\n",
      "And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now that's a nice\n",
      "gateleg table in the corner there. Though of course you'd have to put new\n",
      "hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already\n",
      "gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down\n",
      "and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the\n",
      "prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed\n",
      "anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old\n",
      "man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a\n",
      "rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite\n",
      "the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all----' he began\n",
      "delicately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of an\n",
      "oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There\n",
      "was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was\n",
      "what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It\n",
      "seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The frame's fixed to the wall,' said the old man, 'but I could unscrew it\n",
      "for you, I dare say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know that building,' said Winston finally. 'It's a ruin now. It's in\n",
      "the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in--oh, many years\n",
      "ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement Danes, its name was.' He\n",
      "smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly\n",
      "ridiculous, and added: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What's that?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh--\"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's.\" That was a rhyme\n",
      "we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I don't remember, but I do\n",
      "know it ended up, \"Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a\n",
      "chopper to chop off your head.\" It was a kind of a dance. They held out\n",
      "their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to \"Here comes a\n",
      "chopper to chop off your head\" they brought their arms down and caught you.\n",
      "It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it--all the\n",
      "principal ones, that is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was always\n",
      "difficult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large and\n",
      "impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically\n",
      "claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was\n",
      "obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle\n",
      "Ages. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any\n",
      "value. One could not learn history from architecture any more than one\n",
      "could learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the\n",
      "names of streets--anything that might throw light upon the past had been\n",
      "systematically altered.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's a lot of them left, really,' said the old man, 'though they've\n",
      "been put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go? Ah! I've got it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,\n",
      "  You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "there, now, that's as far as I can get. A farthing, that was a small copper\n",
      "coin, looked something like a cent.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where was St Martin's?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'St Martin's? That's still standing. It's in Victory Square, alongside the\n",
      "picture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars\n",
      "in front, and a big flight of steps.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda displays\n",
      "of various kinds--scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses,\n",
      "waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.\n",
      "\n",
      "'St Martin's-in-the-Fields it used to be called,' supplemented the old man,\n",
      "'though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even more\n",
      "incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry\n",
      "home, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some\n",
      "minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not\n",
      "Weeks--as one might have gathered from the inscription over the\n",
      "shop-front--but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged\n",
      "sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. Throughout that\n",
      "time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never\n",
      "quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that they were talking\n",
      "the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head. Oranges and\n",
      "lemons say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say\n",
      "the bells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to yourself\n",
      "you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London\n",
      "that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one\n",
      "ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so\n",
      "far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells\n",
      "ringing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not\n",
      "to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of\n",
      "the door. He had already made up his mind that after a suitable\n",
      "interval--a month, say--he would take the risk of visiting the shop again.\n",
      "It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre.\n",
      "The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place,\n",
      "after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the\n",
      "shop could be trusted. However----!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps of\n",
      "beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes, take\n",
      "it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his\n",
      "overalls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington's\n",
      "memory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed\n",
      "momentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five seconds exaltation\n",
      "made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much\n",
      "as a preliminary glance through the window. He had even started humming\n",
      "to an improvised tune\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,\n",
      "  You owe me three farthings, say the----\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. A figure\n",
      "in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It was\n",
      "the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light\n",
      "was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked\n",
      "him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not\n",
      "seen him.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to the\n",
      "right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was\n",
      "going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There\n",
      "was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have\n",
      "followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she\n",
      "should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure\n",
      "backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived.\n",
      "It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the\n",
      "Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly\n",
      "mattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seen\n",
      "him go into the pub as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged against\n",
      "his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it\n",
      "away. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes\n",
      "he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon.\n",
      "But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the\n",
      "spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for several seconds\n",
      "wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his\n",
      "steps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him\n",
      "three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her.\n",
      "He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then\n",
      "smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket\n",
      "would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately,\n",
      "because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He\n",
      "could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lusty\n",
      "and would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the Community\n",
      "Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a\n",
      "partial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly\n",
      "lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly and\n",
      "then sit down and be quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. The lights\n",
      "would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into the\n",
      "kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to\n",
      "the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer.\n",
      "But he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice\n",
      "was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the\n",
      "book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thing\n",
      "was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so.\n",
      "Many of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed desperate\n",
      "courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and\n",
      "certain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of\n",
      "astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery\n",
      "of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment\n",
      "when a special effort is needed. He might have silenced the dark-haired\n",
      "girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the\n",
      "extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him that\n",
      "in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but\n",
      "always against one's own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull\n",
      "ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same,\n",
      "he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the\n",
      "battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that\n",
      "you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until\n",
      "it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or\n",
      "screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or\n",
      "cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The woman\n",
      "on the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed to stick into\n",
      "his brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien,\n",
      "for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking\n",
      "of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him\n",
      "away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed was\n",
      "what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet\n",
      "everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to\n",
      "be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the\n",
      "crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why was\n",
      "it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever\n",
      "escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had\n",
      "succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be\n",
      "dead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded\n",
      "in future time?\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of\n",
      "O'Brien. 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' O'Brien\n",
      "had said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where\n",
      "there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see,\n",
      "but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with the\n",
      "voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train\n",
      "of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco\n",
      "promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to\n",
      "spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that\n",
      "of O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of\n",
      "his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm,\n",
      "protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?\n",

      "It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the cubicle to go\n",
      "to the lavatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long,\n",
      "brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone\n",
      "past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop.\n",
      "As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable\n",
      "at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably\n",
      "she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes\n",
      "on which the plots of novels were 'roughed in'. It was a common accident\n",
      "in the Fiction Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost\n",
      "flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must have\n",
      "fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen\n",
      "to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her\n",
      "mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an\n",
      "appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemy\n",
      "who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature,\n",
      "in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively\n",
      "started forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on\n",
      "the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're hurt?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had certainly turned\n",
      "very pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You haven't broken anything?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, I'm all right. It hurt for a moment, that's all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. She had regained\n",
      "some of her colour, and appeared very much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's nothing,' she repeated shortly. 'I only gave my wrist a bit of a\n",
      "bang. Thanks, comrade!'\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going,\n",
      "as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident could\n",
      "not have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear\n",
      "in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct,\n",
      "and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen\n",
      "when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to\n",
      "betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was\n",
      "helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no\n",
      "question that she had done it intentionally. It was something small and\n",
      "flat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his\n",
      "pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paper\n",
      "folded into a square.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to\n",
      "get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on\n",
      "it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets\n",
      "and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.\n",
      "There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens\n",
      "were watched continuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper\n",
      "casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and\n",
      "hitched the speakwrite towards him. 'Five minutes,' he told himself,\n",
      "'five minutes at the very least!' His heart bumped in his breast with\n",
      "frightening loudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was\n",
      "mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing\n",
      "close attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political\n",
      "meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, much\n",
      "the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police,\n",
      "just as he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should\n",
      "choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had\n",
      "their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a\n",
      "summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. But there\n",
      "was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he\n",
      "tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come from\n",
      "the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organization.\n",
      "Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it!\n",
      "No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very\n",
      "instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a couple\n",
      "of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to\n",
      "him. And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably\n",
      "meant death--still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable\n",
      "hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he\n",
      "kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the\n",
      "speakwrite.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic\n",
      "tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose,\n",
      "sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of\n",
      "paper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large\n",
      "unformed handwriting:\n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE YOU.\n",
      "\n",
      "For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating\n",
      "thing into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very well the\n",
      "danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once\n",
      "again, just to make sure that the words were really there.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. What was even\n",
      "worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the\n",
      "need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a\n",
      "fire were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled\n",
      "canteen was torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while during\n",
      "the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped\n",
      "down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of\n",
      "stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.\n",
      "He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of Big\n",
      "Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by\n",
      "his daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket\n",
      "of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was\n",
      "constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once\n",
      "he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the\n",
      "far end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not\n",
      "look in that direction again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a\n",
      "delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and\n",
      "necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a\n",
      "series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast\n",
      "discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under a\n",
      "cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for more\n",
      "than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind\n",
      "altogether. Then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging,\n",
      "intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible\n",
      "to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the\n",
      "Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried\n",
      "off to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a 'discussion group',\n",
      "played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and\n",
      "sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled 'Ingsoc in relation to\n",
      "chess'. His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse\n",
      "to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU\n",
      "the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor\n",
      "risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he\n",
      "was home and in bed--in the darkness, where you were safe even from the\n",
      "telescreen so long as you kept silent--that he was able to think\n",
      "continuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with\n",
      "the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer the\n",
      "possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew\n",
      "that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed\n",
      "him the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well\n",
      "she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his\n",
      "mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with\n",
      "a cobblestone, but that was of no importance. He thought of her naked,\n",
      "youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a fool\n",
      "like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her\n",
      "belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might\n",
      "lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he feared\n",
      "more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he\n",
      "did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of\n",
      "meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when you\n",
      "were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you.\n",
      "Actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to\n",
      "him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think,\n",
      "he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments\n",
      "on a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not\n",
      "be repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might have\n",
      "been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in\n",
      "the building the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going\n",
      "there. If he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work,\n",
      "he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try\n",
      "to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about\n",
      "outside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a\n",
      "letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine that\n",
      "was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few\n",
      "people ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionally\n",
      "necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases,\n",
      "and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not\n",
      "know the girl's name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the\n",
      "safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself,\n",
      "somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and\n",
      "with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round--if these conditions\n",
      "endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day she\n",
      "did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having\n",
      "already blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift. They\n",
      "passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the\n",
      "canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately\n",
      "under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at\n",
      "all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable\n",
      "sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every\n",
      "sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an\n",
      "agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He did\n",
      "not touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in\n",
      "his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a\n",
      "stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There\n",
      "was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might\n",
      "have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end\n",
      "of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her\n",
      "mind and decided to avoid him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had a\n",
      "band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing her was\n",
      "so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several\n",
      "seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her.\n",
      "When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the\n",
      "wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full.\n",
      "The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was\n",
      "held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he\n",
      "had not received his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone\n",
      "when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. He walked\n",
      "casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond\n",
      "her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds would\n",
      "do it. Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended not to hear.\n",
      "'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round.\n",
      "A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew,\n",
      "was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not\n",
      "safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit at\n",
      "a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with\n",
      "a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a\n",
      "hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it.\n",
      "The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take\n",
      "the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely enough, she was at\n",
      "a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediately\n",
      "ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man\n",
      "with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from\n",
      "the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight\n",
      "for the girl's table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a\n",
      "table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested\n",
      "that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the\n",
      "emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston followed. It was no use\n",
      "unless he could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendous\n",
      "crash. The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying,\n",
      "two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He started\n",
      "to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently\n",
      "suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds\n",
      "later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl's table.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating.\n",
      "It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now\n",
      "a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by since\n",
      "she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must\n",
      "have changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should end\n",
      "successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might have\n",
      "flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen\n",
      "Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with\n",
      "a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth\n",
      "was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if\n",
      "he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both\n",
      "Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was\n",
      "a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston\n",
      "began speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the\n",
      "watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few\n",
      "necessary words in low expressionless voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What time do you leave work?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Eighteen-thirty.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where can we meet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Victory Square, near the monument.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's full of telescreens.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Any signal?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No. Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. And don't\n",
      "look at me. Just keep somewhere near me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What time?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nineteen hours.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'All right.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table. They did\n",
      "not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on\n",
      "opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. The\n",
      "girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to\n",
      "smoke a cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered round\n",
      "the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother's\n",
      "statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the\n",
      "Eurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years\n",
      "ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there was\n",
      "a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver\n",
      "Cromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared.\n",
      "Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she had\n",
      "changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of the square and\n",
      "got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin's Church,\n",
      "whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed 'You owe me three farthings.'\n",
      "Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading or\n",
      "pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. It was not\n",
      "safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There were\n",
      "telescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was a din of\n",
      "shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly\n",
      "everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly\n",
      "round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush.\n",
      "Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that\n",
      "a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square.\n",
      "Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer\n",
      "edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward\n",
      "into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of the girl,\n",
      "but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous\n",
      "woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of\n",
      "flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed\n",
      "to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his\n",
      "entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he\n",
      "had broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were\n",
      "shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machine\n",
      "guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street.\n",
      "In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting,\n",
      "jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides\n",
      "of the trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there\n",
      "was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons.\n",
      "Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed. Winston knew they\n",
      "were there but he saw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, and\n",
      "her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was\n",
      "almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken\n",
      "charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began\n",
      "speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely\n",
      "moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling\n",
      "of the trucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can you hear me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can you get Sunday afternoon off?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember this. Go to Paddington\n",
      "Station----'\n",
      "\n",
      "With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she outlined the\n",
      "route that he was to follow. A half-hour railway journey; turn left outside\n",
      "the station; two kilometres along the road; a gate with the top bar\n",
      "missing; a path across a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes;\n",

      "She need not have told him that. But for the moment they could not\n",
      "extricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were still filing past,\n",
      "the people still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boos\n",
      "and hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and\n",
      "had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners,\n",
      "whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. One\n",
      "literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as\n",
      "prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did\n",
      "one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as\n",
      "war-criminals: the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labour\n",
      "camps. The round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European\n",
      "type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyes\n",
      "looked into Winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away\n",
      "again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an\n",
      "aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists\n",
      "crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them bound\n",

      "\n",
      "It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that\n",
      "their hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detail\n",
      "of her hand. He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the\n",
      "work-hardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the\n",
      "wrist. Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the\n",
      "same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the\n",
      "girl's eyes were. They were probably brown, but people with dark hair\n",
      "sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would have\n",
      "been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among\n",
      "the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead\n",
      "of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully\n",

      "Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade,\n",
      "stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under the\n",
      "trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air\n",
      "seemed to kiss one's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deeper\n",
      "in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring-doves.\n",

      "He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties about the journey, and\n",
      "the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he\n",
      "would normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe\n",
      "place. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the\n",
      "country than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, but there\n",
      "was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might\n",

      "by yourself without attracting attention. For distances of less than\n",
      "100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but\n",
      "sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who\n",
      "examined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkward\n",
      "questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the\n",
      "station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not\n",
      "being followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of\n",
      "the summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was\n",
      "filled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothless\n",
      "great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon\n",
      "with 'in-laws' in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston,\n",

      "\n",
      "The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him\n",
      "of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch,\n",
      "but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot\n",
      "that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began\n",
      "picking some partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that\n",
      "he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they\n",
      "met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly\n",
      "scent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a\n",
      "foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best thing to do.\n",
      "It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To look\n",
      "round was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell\n",
      "lightly on his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning\n",
      "that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the way\n",
      "along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way\n",
      "before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed,\n",
      "still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but as\n",
      "he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet\n",
      "sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the\n",
      "sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite\n",
      "likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back\n",
      "after all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted\n",
      "him. Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him\n",
      "feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of\n",
      "London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had\n",
      "probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to the\n",
      "fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apart\n",
      "the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston\n",
      "followed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy\n",
      "knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. The girl\n",
      "stopped and turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Here we are,' she said.\n",

      "\n",
      "'I didn't want to say anything in the lane,' she went on, 'in case there's\n",
      "a mike hidden there. I don't suppose there is, but there could be. There's\n",
      "always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. We're all\n",
      "right here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He still had not the courage to approach her. 'We're all right here?'\n",

      "\n",
      "They were only making conversation. He had managed to move closer to her\n",
      "now. She stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face that\n",
      "looked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slow\n",
      "to act. The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to have\n",
      "fallen of their own accord. He took her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you believe,' he said, 'that till this moment I didn't know what\n",
      "colour your eyes were?' They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of\n",
      "brown, with dark lashes. 'Now that you've seen what I'm really like,\n",

      "\n",
      "The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his arms.\n",
      "At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthful\n",
      "body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his\n",
      "face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the\n",
      "wide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling\n",
      "him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down on to the\n",
      "ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her.\n",
      "But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere\n",
      "contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was\n",
      "happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and\n",
      "prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without\n",
      "women--he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled a\n",
      "bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round his\n",

      "\n",
      "'Never mind, dear. There's no hurry. We've got the whole afternoon. Isn't\n",

      "\n",
      "'I hated the sight of you,' he said. 'I wanted to rape you and then murder\n",
      "you afterwards. Two weeks ago I thought seriously of smashing your head in\n",

      "sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging it on to a bough. Then,\n",
      "as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in\n",
      "the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She\n",
      "broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he had\n",
      "taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. It was\n",
      "dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. Chocolate normally was\n",
      "dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it,\n",
      "like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted\n",
      "chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scent\n",
      "had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was\n",
      "powerful and troubling.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where did you get this stuff?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Black market,' she said indifferently. 'Actually I am that sort of girl,\n",
      "to look at. I'm good at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I do\n",
      "voluntary work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours\n",
      "and hours I've spent pasting their bloody rot all over London. I always\n",
      "carry one end of a banner in the processions. I always look cheerful and\n",
      "I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that's what I say.\n",
      "It's the only way to be safe.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The first fragment of chocolate had melted on Winston's tongue. The taste\n",
      "was delightful. But there was still that memory moving round the edges of\n",
      "his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite\n",
      "shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. He pushed it\n",
      "away from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action which he\n",
      "would have liked to undo but could not.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are very young,' he said. 'You are ten or fifteen years younger than\n",
      "I am. What could you see to attract you in a man like me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was something in your face. I thought I'd take a chance. I'm good at\n",

      "against THEM.'\n",
      "\n",
      "THEM, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner Party, about\n",
      "whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy,\n",
      "although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere.\n",
      "A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language.\n",
      "Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom\n",
      "did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention\n",
      "the Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words\n",
      "that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It\n",
      "was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways,\n",
      "and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that\n",
      "smells bad hay. They had left the clearing and were wandering again\n",
      "through the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waists\n",
      "whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how much\n",
      "softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not\n",
      "speak above a whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better to\n",
      "go quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. She\n",
      "stopped him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't go out into the open. There might be someone watching. We're all\n",
      "right if we keep behind the boughs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sunlight, filtering\n",
      "through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. Winston looked\n",
      "out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of\n",
      "recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, close-bitten pasture, with a\n",
      "footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged\n",
      "hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just\n",
      "perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense\n",
      "masses like women's hair. Surely somewhere nearby, but out of sight,\n",
      "there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming?\n",
      "\n",
      "'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's right, there is a stream. It's at the edge of the next field,\n",
      "actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You can watch them lying\n",
      "in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's the Golden Country--almost,' he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Golden Country?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's nothing, really. A landscape I've seen sometimes in a dream.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Look!' whispered Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the level\n",
      "of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in\n",
      "the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place\n",
      "again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance\n",
      "to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the\n",
      "afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung\n",
      "together, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with\n",
      "astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the\n",
      "bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped\n",
      "for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its\n",
      "speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort\n",
      "of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate,\n",
      "no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood\n",
      "and pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there\n",
      "was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in\n",
      "low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would\n",
      "pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small,\n",
      "beetle-like man was listening intently--listening to that. But by degrees\n",
      "the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as\n",
      "though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got\n",
      "mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped\n",
      "thinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft\n",
      "and warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body\n",
      "seemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as\n",
      "water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard\n",
      "kisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart again\n",
      "both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright and fled with a clatter\n",
      "of wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston put his lips against her ear. 'NOW,' he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not here,' she whispered back. 'Come back to the hide-out. It's safer.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way back\n",
      "to the clearing. When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned\n",
      "and faced him. They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared\n",
      "round the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant,\n",
      "then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his\n",
      "dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes\n",
      "off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent\n",
      "gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body\n",
      "gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body;\n",
      "his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile.\n",
      "He knelt down before her and took her hands in his.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you done this before?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course. Hundreds of times--well, scores of times, anyway.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'With Party members?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, always with Party members.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'With members of the Inner Party?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not with those swine, no. But there's plenty that WOULD if they got half\n",
      "a chance. They're not so holy as they make out.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been\n",
      "hundreds--thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him\n",
      "with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface,\n",
      "its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing\n",
      "iniquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or\n",
      "syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to\n",
      "undermine! He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Listen. The more men you've had, the more I love you. Do you understand\n",
      "that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, perfectly.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere.\n",
      "I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I'm corrupt to the bones.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You like doing this? I don't mean simply me: I mean the thing in itself?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I adore it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of one\n",

      "upon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no\n",
      "difficulty. Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to\n",
      "normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The\n",
      "sun seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached out for\n",

      "you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes,\n",
      "if you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and\n",

      "old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it was\n",
      "desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure\n",
      "love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was\n",
      "mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax\n",
      "a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.\n",

      "She had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings\n",
      "hence. It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an\n",

      "about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or\n",
      "sewing-thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow\n",
      "her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without\n",

      "where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good\n",
      "hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very\n",
      "dangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different\n",
      "place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the\n",
      "street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted\n",
      "down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one\n",
      "another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked\n",
      "on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence\n",
      "by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then\n",
      "taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly\n",
      "cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without\n",
      "introduction on the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this\n",
      "kind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'. She was\n",
      "also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in\n",
      "almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They\n",
      "were passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when\n",
      "they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the\n",
      "earth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his\n",
      "side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at\n",
      "hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his\n",
      "own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was\n",
      "dead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live\n",
      "warm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his\n",
      "lips. Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.\n",

      "There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to\n",
      "walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round\n",
      "the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. Even if it had been\n",
      "less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet.\n",
      "Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, and\n",
      "their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not\n",
      "often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.\n",
      "She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and\n",
      "demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior Anti-Sex League,\n",
      "preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings\n",
      "campaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it was camouflage.\n",
      "If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even induced\n",
      "Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for\n",
      "the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party\n",
      "members. So, one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of paralysing\n",
      "boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts\n",

      "chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor.\n",
      "She was 'not clever', but was fond of using her hands and felt at home\n",
      "with machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel,\n",
      "from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the\n",
      "final touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not interested in the\n",

      "the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap\n",
      "pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House\n",
      "by the people who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for\n",
      "a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like\n",
      "'Spanking Stories' or 'One Night in a Girls' School', to be bought\n",
      "furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they\n",

      "heads of the departments, were girls. The theory was that men, whose sex\n",

      "confessed.' Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw it\n",
      "was quite simple. You wanted a good time; 'they', meaning the Party,\n",
      "wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. She\n",
      "seemed to think it just as natural that 'they' should want to rob you of\n",
      "your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. She hated\n",
      "the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general\n",
      "criticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had no\n",
      "interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak words\n",
      "except the ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard of\n",
      "the Brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. Any kind of\n",
      "organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure,\n",
      "struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stay\n",
      "alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many others like her there\n",
      "might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of\n",
      "the Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as something\n",
      "unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply\n",
      "evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.\n",

      "\n",
      "She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, everything came back\n",
      "to her own sexuality. As soon as this was touched upon in any way she was\n",
      "capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner\n",
      "meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex\n",
      "instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control\n",
      "and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more\n",
      "important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable\n",
      "because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way\n",
      "she put it was:\n",
      "\n",
      "'When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy\n",
      "and don't give a damn for anything. They can't bear you to feel like that.\n",
      "They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching\n",
      "up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If\n",
      "you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother\n",
      "and the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of\n",
      "their bloody rot?'\n",
      "\n",
      "That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connexion\n",
      "between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the\n",
      "hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be\n",
      "kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct\n",
      "and using it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the\n",
      "Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similar\n",
      "trick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually be\n",
      "abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their\n",
      "children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand,\n",
      "were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them\n",
      "and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension\n",
      "of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be\n",
      "surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine would unquestionably\n",
      "have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be too\n",
      "stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled\n",
      "her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which\n",
      "had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia of\n",
      "something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another\n",
      "sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost their\n",
      "way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged behind\n",
      "the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and\n",
      "presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk\n",
      "quarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at the\n",
      "bottom. There was nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she\n",
      "realized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy. To be away\n",
      "from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of\n",
      "wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start\n",
      "searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed some\n",
      "tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them.\n",
      "One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on\n",
      "the same root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called\n",
      "to Katharine to come and look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump down near the bottom.\n",
      "Do you see they're two different colours?'\n",
      "\n",
      "She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back for\n",
      "a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was\n",
      "pointing. He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on\n",
      "her waist to steady her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how\n",
      "completely alone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, not a\n",
      "leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like this the danger that\n",
      "there would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was a\n",
      "microphone it would only pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour\n",
      "of the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his\n",
      "face. And the thought struck him...\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why didn't you give her a good shove?' said Julia. 'I would have.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, dear, you would have. I would, if I'd been the same person then as\n",
      "I am now. Or perhaps I would--I'm not certain.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are you sorry you didn't?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes. On the whole I'm sorry I didn't.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. He pulled her closer\n",
      "against him. Her head rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell of her\n",
      "hair conquering the pigeon dung. She was very young, he thought, she\n",
      "still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push\n",
      "an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Actually it would have made no difference,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then why are you sorry you didn't do it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we're\n",
      "playing, we can't win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds,\n",
      "that's all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradicted\n",
      "him when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it as a law\n",
      "of nature that the individual is always defeated. In a way she realized\n",
      "that she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would\n",
      "catch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believed\n",
      "that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could\n",
      "live as you chose. All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. She\n",
      "did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the\n",
      "only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from\n",
      "the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself\n",
      "as a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We are the dead,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We're not dead yet,' said Julia prosaically.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not physically. Six months, a year--five years, conceivably. I am afraid\n",
      "of death. You are young, so presumably you're more afraid of it than I am.\n",
      "Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. But it makes very little\n",
      "difference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the\n",
      "same thing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? Don't\n",
      "you enjoy being alive? Don't you like feeling: This is me, this is my hand,\n",
      "this is my leg, I'm real, I'm solid, I'm alive! Don't you like THIS?'\n",
      "\n",
      "She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him. He could feel\n",
      "her breasts, ripe yet firm, through her overalls. Her body seemed to be\n",
      "pouring some of its youth and vigour into his.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, I like that,' he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's shop.\n",
      "Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and\n",
      "a coverless bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was\n",
      "ticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, the\n",
      "glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out\n",
      "of the half-darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups,\n",
      "provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water\n",
      "to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some\n",
      "saccharine tablets. The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was\n",
      "nineteen-twenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly.\n",
      "Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit, this one was the least\n",
      "possible to conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his head in\n",
      "the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface\n",
      "of the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made no\n",
      "difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollars\n",
      "that it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively\n",
      "knowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose\n",
      "of a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in\n",
      "generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he\n",
      "had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing.\n",
      "Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. And when\n",
      "they had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew\n",
      "of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to fade\n",
      "out of existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to the\n",
      "house, one of them through the back yard, which gave on an alley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped out, secure in the\n",
      "protection of the muslin curtain. The June sun was still high in the sky,\n",
      "and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman\n",
      "pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her\n",
      "middle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line,\n",
      "pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized as\n",
      "babies' diapers. Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she\n",
      "was singing in a powerful contralto:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was only an 'opeless fancy.\n",
      "  It passed like an Ipril dye,\n",
      "  But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred!\n",
      "  They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It was one of countless\n",
      "similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub-section of\n",
      "the Music Department. The words of these songs were composed without any\n",
      "human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator.\n",
      "But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an\n",
      "almost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of\n",
      "her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street,\n",
      "and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the\n",
      "room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable that they could\n",
      "frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. But\n",
      "the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors\n",
      "and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time\n",
      "after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange\n",
      "meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of\n",
      "Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex\n",
      "preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody.\n",
      "Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day.\n",
      "They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening\n",
      "beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked\n",
      "at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from the\n",
      "short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's all off,' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak.\n",
      "'Tomorrow, I mean.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tomorrow afternoon. I can't come.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why not?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, the usual reason. It's started early this time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had known\n",
      "her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning there\n",
      "had been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had been\n",
      "simply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The\n",
      "smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed\n",
      "to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a\n",
      "physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he\n",
      "had a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling\n",
      "that she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed\n",
      "them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of his\n",
      "fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It\n",
      "struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment\n",
      "must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had\n",
      "not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they\n",
      "were a married couple of ten years' standing. He wished that he were\n",
      "walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly\n",
      "and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the\n",
      "household. He wished above all that they had some place where they could\n",
      "be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time\n",
      "they met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the\n",
      "following day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had occurred\n",
      "to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected\n",
      "readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were\n",
      "intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the\n",
      "edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.\n",
      "It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's\n",
      "consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as\n",
      "surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps\n",
      "postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful\n",
      "act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into the\n",
      "room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had\n",
      "sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward\n",
      "to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly,\n",
      "partly because she was still holding the tool-bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Half a second,' she said. 'Just let me show you what I've brought. Did\n",
      "you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? I thought you would. You\n",
      "can chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. Look here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spanners\n",
      "and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. Underneath were a number\n",
      "of neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston had a\n",
      "strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of\n",
      "heavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't sugar?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here's a loaf of bread--proper\n",
      "white bread, not our bloody stuff--and a little pot of jam. And here's a\n",
      "tin of milk--but look! This is the one I'm really proud of. I had to wrap\n",
      "a bit of sacking round it, because----'\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. The smell was\n",
      "already filling the room, a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation\n",
      "from his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with even\n",
      "now, blowing down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusing itself\n",
      "mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lost\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's coffee,' he murmured, 'real coffee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's Inner Party coffee. There's a whole kilo here,' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How did you manage to get hold of all these things?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's all Inner Party stuff. There's nothing those swine don't have,\n",
      "nothing. But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things,\n",
      "and--look, I got a little packet of tea as well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a corner of the packet.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's real tea. Not blackberry leaves.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured India, or\n",
      "something,' she said vaguely. 'But listen, dear. I want you to turn your\n",
      "back on me for three minutes. Go and sit on the other side of the bed.\n",
      "Don't go too near the window. And don't turn round till I tell you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. Down in the yard\n",
      "the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and\n",
      "the line. She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep\n",
      "feeling:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  They sye that time 'eals all things,\n",
      "  They sye you can always forget;\n",
      "  But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years\n",
      "  They twist my 'eart-strings yet!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. Her voice floated\n",
      "upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort of\n",
      "happy melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly\n",
      "content, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes\n",
      "inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers\n",
      "and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he had never\n",
      "heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even\n",
      "have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to\n",
      "oneself. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation\n",
      "level that they had anything to sing about.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You can turn round now,' said Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What he\n",
      "had actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not naked. The\n",
      "transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. She\n",
      "had painted her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought\n",
      "herself a complete set of make-up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened,\n",
      "her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something\n",
      "under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but\n",
      "Winston's standards in such matters were not high. He had never before\n",
      "seen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The\n",
      "improvement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour\n",
      "in the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above\n",
      "all, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added\n",
      "to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets\n",
      "flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness of a basement\n",
      "kitchen, and a woman's cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that\n",
      "she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Scent too!' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I'm going to do next? I'm\n",
      "going to get hold of a real woman's frock from somewhere and wear it\n",
      "instead of these bloody trousers. I'll wear silk stockings and high-heeled\n",
      "shoes! In this room I'm going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. It\n",
      "was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence.\n",
      "Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with\n",
      "the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch\n",
      "over his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was\n",
      "threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonished\n",
      "both of them. 'It's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?' said Julia.\n",
      "One never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles.\n",
      "Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia had never been\n",
      "in one before, so far as she could remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up the\n",
      "hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, because\n",
      "Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her\n",
      "make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light\n",
      "stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray\n",
      "from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the\n",
      "fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard\n",
      "the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in\n",
      "from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had\n",
      "been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer\n",
      "evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose,\n",
      "talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply\n",
      "lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could\n",
      "never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed\n",
      "her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Half that water's boiled away,' she said. 'I'll get up and make some\n",
      "coffee in another moment. We've got an hour. What time do they cut the\n",
      "lights off at your flats?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Twenty-three thirty.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that,\n",
      "because--Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor,\n",
      "and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly\n",
      "as he had seen her fling the dictionary at Goldstein, that morning during\n",
      "the Two Minutes Hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What was it?' he said in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. There's a\n",
      "hole down there. I gave him a good fright, anyway.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Rats!' murmured Winston. 'In this room!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'They're all over the place,' said Julia indifferently as she lay down\n",
      "again. 'We've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. Some parts of\n",
      "London are swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? Yes,\n",
      "they do. In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for\n",
      "two minutes. It's the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nasty\n",
      "thing is that the brutes always----'\n",
      "\n",
      "'DON'T GO ON!' said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Dearest! You've gone quite pale. What's the matter? Do they make you feel\n",
      "sick?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of all horrors in the world--a rat!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though\n",
      "to reassure him with the warmth of her body. He did not reopen his eyes\n",
      "immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a\n",
      "nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was\n",
      "always very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness,\n",
      "and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too\n",
      "dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of\n",
      "self-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of\n",
      "darkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own\n",
      "brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He always woke\n",
      "up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with what\n",
      "Julia had been saying when he cut her short.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm sorry,' he said, 'it's nothing. I don't like rats, that's all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here.\n",
      "I'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. And next time we\n",
      "come here I'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feeling slightly\n",
      "ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed,\n",
      "pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from the\n",
      "saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest\n",
      "anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was even\n",
      "better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by\n",
      "the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine.\n",
      "With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other,\n",
      "Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase,\n",
      "pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself\n",
      "down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining\n",
      "the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She brought\n",
      "the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better\n",
      "light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft,\n",
      "rainwatery appearance of the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is it, do you think?' said Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't think it's anything--I mean, I don't think it was ever put to any\n",
      "use. That's what I like about it. It's a little chunk of history that\n",
      "they've forgotten to alter. It's a message from a hundred years ago, if\n",
      "one knew how to read it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And that picture over there'--she nodded at the engraving on the opposite\n",
      "wall--'would that be a hundred years old?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can't tell. It's impossible to discover\n",
      "the age of anything nowadays.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She went over to look at it. 'Here's where that brute stuck his nose out,'\n",
      "she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture. 'What is\n",
      "this place? I've seen it before somewhere.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes its name was.'\n",
      "The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught him came back into\n",
      "his head, and he added half-nostalgically: \"Oranges and lemons, say the\n",
      "bells of St Clement's!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To his astonishment she capped the line:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  'You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,\n",
      "  When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey----'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can't remember how it goes on after that. But anyway I remember it ends\n",
      "up, \"Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop\n",
      "off your head!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like the two halves of a countersign. But there must be another\n",
      "line after 'the bells of Old Bailey'. Perhaps it could be dug out of\n",
      "Mr Charrington's memory, if he were suitably prompted.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who taught you that?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little girl. He was\n",
      "vaporized when I was eight--at any rate, he disappeared. I wonder what a\n",
      "lemon was,' she added inconsequently. 'I've seen oranges. They're a kind\n",
      "of round yellow fruit with a thick skin.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can remember lemons,' said Winston. 'They were quite common in the\n",
      "fifties. They were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell\n",
      "them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I bet that picture's got bugs behind it,' said Julia. 'I'll take it down\n",

      "difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when\n",
      "Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that\n",
      "it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside\n",

      "Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the\n",

      "fabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty\n",
      "of finding one's way into it. He told her of the strange intimacy that\n",
      "existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of the\n",
      "impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien's presence, announce\n",
      "that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough,\n",
      "this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to\n",
      "judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston\n",
      "should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash\n",
      "of the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly\n",
      "everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought\n",
      "it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized\n",
      "opposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and his\n",
      "underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party\n",
      "had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe\n",
      "in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations,\n",
      "she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose\n",
      "names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the\n",
      "faintest belief. When public trials were happening she had taken her place\n",
      "in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from\n",

      "the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults\n",
      "at Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and\n",
      "what doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up since the\n",
      "Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the\n",
      "fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an independent political movement was\n",
      "outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. It\n",
      "would always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel\n",
      "against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of\n",
      "violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible\n",
      "to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mention\n",
      "the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her\n",
      "opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on\n",
      "London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, 'just to\n",
      "keep people frightened'. This was an idea that had literally never occurred\n",
      "to him. She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during\n",
      "the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out\n",
      "laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they\n",
      "in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept\n",
      "the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and\n",
      "falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having\n",
      "learnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own\n",
      "schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the\n",
      "helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later,\n",
      "when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one\n",
      "generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he\n",
      "told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long\n",
      "before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. After\n",
      "all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more\n",
      "of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did\n",
      "not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia\n",
      "and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as\n",
      "a sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy\n",
      "had changed. 'I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia,' she said\n",
      "vaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated\n",
      "from long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happened\n",
      "only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her about\n",
      "it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing\n",
      "her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and\n",
      "not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as\n",
      "unimportant. 'Who cares?' she said impatiently. 'It's always one bloody\n",
      "war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent\n",
      "forgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to horrify\n",
      "her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought\n",
      "of lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and\n",
      "Rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between\n",
      "his fingers. It did not make much impression on her. At first, indeed, she\n",

      "when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence\n",
      "ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know\n",
      "with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Just in\n",

      "woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of\n",
      "nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed\n",
      "were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered\n",
      "from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is\n",
      "ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved\n",
      "him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. When\n",
      "the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in\n",

      "natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered\n",
      "the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bullets\n",
      "than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done was to\n",
      "persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while\n",
      "at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When\n",
      "once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel,\n",
      "what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference.\n",
      "Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever\n",
      "heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream of history. And\n",
      "yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed\n",
      "all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They\n",
      "were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What\n",
      "mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture,\n",
      "an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in\n",
      "itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this\n",
      "condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they\n",
      "were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not\n",
      "despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would\n",
      "one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed\n",
      "human. They had not become hardened inside. They had held on to the\n",
      "primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort.\n",
      "And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few\n",

      "your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us will even know\n",

      "another, although even that can't make the slightest difference.'\n",
      "\n",

      "'I don't mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do\n",

      "can't make you believe it. They can't get inside you.'\n",

      "true when you were actually in their hands. One did not know what happened\n",

      "wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That too was intimidating. Winston\n",
      "could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not\n",
      "grimy from the contact of human bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying\n",
      "it intently. His heavy face, bent down so that one could see the line of\n",
      "the nose, looked both formidable and intelligent. For perhaps twenty\n",
      "seconds he sat without stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite towards\n",
      "him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion\n",
      "contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop\n",
      "unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery\n",
      "overheads stop end message.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the\n",
      "soundless carpet. A little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen\n",
      "away from him with the Newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than\n",
      "usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that\n",
      "Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary\n",
      "embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a\n",
      "stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was any\n",
      "kind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single\n",
      "equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on\n",
      "a dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to\n",
      "borrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossible\n",
      "to explain. As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike\n",
      "him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There was\n",
      "a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even in the midst\n",
      "of his panic, Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his\n",
      "tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You can turn it off!' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said O'Brien, 'we can turn it off. We have that privilege.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them,\n",
      "and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was waiting,\n",
      "somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it was\n",
      "quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he\n",
      "had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen\n",
      "the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With\n",
      "difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then\n",
      "suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings\n",
      "of a smile. With his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettled his\n",
      "spectacles on his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I will say it,' said Winston promptly. 'That thing is really turned off?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We have come here because----'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of\n",
      "his own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind of\n",
      "help he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why he\n",
      "had come here. He went on, conscious that what he was saying\n",
      "must sound both feeble and pretentious:\n",
      "\n",
      "'We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secret\n",
      "organization working against the Party, and that you are involved in it.\n",
      "We want to join it and work for it. We are enemies of the Party. We\n",
      "disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are\n",
      "also adulterers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your\n",
      "mercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way, we are\n",
      "ready.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door\n",
      "had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come in\n",
      "without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter\n",
      "and glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively. 'Bring the drinks over\n",
      "here, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have we enough chairs? Then\n",
      "we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself,\n",
      "Martin. This is business. You can stop being a servant for the next ten\n",
      "minutes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a\n",
      "servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Winston\n",
      "regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man's\n",
      "whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to\n",
      "drop his assumed personality even for a moment. O'Brien took the decanter\n",
      "by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused\n",
      "in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a\n",
      "hoarding--a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move\n",
      "up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top the\n",
      "stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby.\n",
      "It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at\n",
      "it with frank curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile. 'You will have read\n",
      "about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party, I am\n",
      "afraid.' His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'I think it\n",
      "is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To\n",
      "Emmanuel Goldstein.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine was a thing he\n",
      "had read and dreamed about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington's\n",
      "half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the\n",
      "olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason\n",
      "he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like\n",
      "that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. Actually,\n",
      "when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. The\n",
      "truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it. He\n",
      "set down the empty glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do not know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And the conspiracy--the organization? Is it real? It is not simply an\n",
      "invention of the Thought Police?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never learn much\n",
      "more about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it.\n",
      "I will come back to that presently.' He looked at his wrist-watch. 'It is\n",
      "unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for\n",
      "more than half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and\n",
      "you will have to leave separately. You, comrade'--he bowed his head to\n",
      "Julia--'will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.\n",
      "You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions.\n",
      "In general terms, what are you prepared to do?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Anything that we are capable of,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing\n",
      "Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted that\n",
      "Winston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down over his\n",
      "eyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as\n",
      "though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers\n",
      "were known to him already.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are prepared to give your lives?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are prepared to commit murder?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of\n",
      "innocent people?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To betray your country to foreign powers?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the minds\n",
      "of children, to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage prostitution,\n",
      "to disseminate venereal diseases--to do anything which is likely to cause\n",
      "demoralization and weaken the power of the Party?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric\n",
      "acid in a child's face--are you prepared to do that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life\n",
      "as a waiter or a dock-worker?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",

      "'You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another\n",
      "again?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No!' broke in Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered. For a\n",
      "moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. His\n",
      "tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word,\n",
      "then of the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he did not\n",
      "know which word he was going to say. 'No,' he said finally.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You did well to tell me,' said O'Brien. 'It is necessary for us to know\n",
      "everything.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more\n",
      "expression in it:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different\n",
      "person? We may be obliged to give him a new identity. His face, his\n",
      "movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair--even his voice\n",
      "would be different. And you yourself might have become a different person.\n",
      "Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it is\n",
      "necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's\n",
      "Mongolian face. There were no scars that he could see. Julia had turned a\n",
      "shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brien\n",
      "boldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good. Then that is settled.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather\n",
      "absent-minded air O'Brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself,\n",
      "then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think\n",
      "better standing. They were very good cigarettes, very thick and\n",
      "well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O'Brien looked at\n",
      "his wrist-watch again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,' he said. 'I shall switch\n",
      "on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look at these comrades' faces\n",
      "before you go. You will be seeing them again. I may not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes\n",
      "flickered over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in his\n",
      "manner. He was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in\n",
      "them, or appeared to feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic\n",
      "face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without speaking\n",
      "or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the door\n",
      "silently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the\n",
      "pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You understand,' he said, 'that you will be fighting in the dark. You\n",
      "will always be in the dark. You will receive orders and you will obey them,\n",
      "without knowing why. Later I shall send you a book from which you will\n",
      "learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which\n",
      "we shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you will be full members\n",
      "of the Brotherhood. But between the general aims that we are fighting for\n",
      "and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. I\n",
      "tell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it\n",
      "numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal knowledge\n",
      "you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. You\n",
      "will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as\n",
      "they disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be preserved. When\n",
      "you receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary to\n",
      "communicate with you, it will be through Martin. When you are finally\n",
      "caught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. But you will have very\n",
      "little to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be able to\n",
      "betray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will not\n",
      "even betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a\n",
      "different person, with a different face.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In spite of the\n",
      "bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. It\n",
      "came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket,\n",
      "or manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an\n",
      "impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. However\n",
      "much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that\n",
      "belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease,\n",
      "amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage.\n",
      "'This is unavoidable,' his voice seemed to say; 'this is what we have got\n",
      "to do, unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life is\n",
      "worth living again.' A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out\n",
      "from Winston towards O'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the shadowy\n",
      "figure of Goldstein. When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders and\n",
      "his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible\n",
      "to believe that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was\n",
      "not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed to\n",
      "be impressed. She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently.\n",
      "O'Brien went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "'You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt\n",
      "you have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, a\n",
      "huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling\n",
      "messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special\n",
      "movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the\n",
      "Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible\n",
      "for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others.\n",
      "Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could\n",
      "not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would\n",
      "lead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot\n",
      "be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense.\n",
      "Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible. You\n",
      "will never have anything to sustain you, except the idea. You will get no\n",
      "comradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are caught, you will\n",
      "get no help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutely\n",
      "necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to\n",
      "smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. You will have to get used\n",
      "to living without results and without hope. You will work for a while,\n",
      "you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are\n",
      "the only results that you will ever see. There is no possibility that any\n",
      "perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead.\n",
      "Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls\n",
      "of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there\n",
      "is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible\n",
      "except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act\n",
      "collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to\n",
      "individual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Police\n",
      "there is no other way.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said to Julia. 'Wait.\n",
      "The decanter is still half full.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faint\n",
      "suggestion of irony. 'To the confusion of the Thought Police? To the\n",
      "death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the future?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To the past,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up to go.\n",
      "O'Brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat\n",
      "white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. It was important,\n",
      "he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very\n",
      "observant. As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget\n",
      "her existence. He took another pace or two up and down, then stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There are details to be settled,' he said. 'I assume that you have a\n",
      "hiding-place of some kind?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston explained about the room over Mr Charrington's shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That will do for the moment. Later we will arrange something else for you.\n",
      "It is important to change one's hiding-place frequently. Meanwhile I shall\n",
      "send you a copy of THE BOOK'--even O'Brien, Winston noticed, seemed to\n",
      "pronounce the words as though they were in italics--'Goldstein's book, you\n",
      "understand, as soon as possible. It may be some days before I can get hold\n",
      "of one. There are not many in existence, as you can imagine. The Thought\n",
      "Police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce\n",
      "them. It makes very little difference. The book is indestructible. If\n",
      "the last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word for word. Do\n",
      "you carry a brief-case to work with you?' he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "'As a rule, yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is it like?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Black, very shabby. With two straps.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Black, two straps, very shabby--good. One day in the fairly near\n",
      "future--I cannot give a date--one of the messages among your morning's\n",
      "work will contain a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for a\n",
      "repeat. On the following day you will go to work without your brief-case.\n",
      "At some time during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the\n",
      "arm and say \"I think you have dropped your brief-case.\" The one he gives\n",
      "you will contain a copy of Goldstein's book. You will return it within\n",
      "fourteen days.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They were silent for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There are a couple of minutes before you need go,' said O'Brien. 'We\n",
      "shall meet again--if we do meet again----'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston looked up at him. 'In the place where there is no darkness?'\n",
      "he said hesitantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. 'In the place where there\n",
      "is no darkness,' he said, as though he had recognized the allusion. 'And\n",
      "in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave?\n",
      "Any message? Any question?.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that he\n",
      "wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding\n",
      "generalities. Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien or the\n",
      "Brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the\n",
      "dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room\n",
      "over Mr Charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel\n",
      "engraving in its rosewood frame. Almost at random he said:\n",

      "say the bells of St Clement's\"?'\n",
      "\n",

      "stanza:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,\n",

      "up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of\n",

      "always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work.\n",
      "What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.\n",
      "Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any\n",

      "it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the\n",
      "speakwrite, every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was\n",

      "The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event\n",
      "which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth\n",
      "century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire\n",
      "by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and\n",
      "Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only\n",
      "emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. The\n",
      "frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and\n",
      "in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general\n",
      "they follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern\n",
      "part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering\n",
      "Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the\n",

      "smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier,\n",
      "comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands\n",
      "and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at\n",
      "war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is no\n",
      "longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early\n",
      "decades of the twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between\n",
      "combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause\n",
      "for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference.\n",
      "This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing\n",
      "attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous.\n",
      "On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,\n",
      "and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction\n",
      "of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which\n",
      "extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal,\n",
      "and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy,\n",
      "meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of\n",
      "people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few\n",
      "casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague\n",
      "frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round\n",
      "the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In\n",
      "the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage\n",
      "of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may\n",
      "cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its character. More\n",
      "exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of\n",
      "importance. Motives which were already present to some small extent in the\n",
      "great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and\n",
      "are consciously recognized and acted upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the nature of the present war--for in spite of the regrouping\n",
      "which occurs every few years, it is always the same war--one must realize\n",
      "in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of\n",
      "the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other\n",
      "two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences\n",
      "are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceania\n",
      "by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity\n",
      "and industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in\n",
      "a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of\n",
      "self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared\n",
      "to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of\n",
      "previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials\n",
      "is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three\n",
      "super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that\n",
      "it needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct\n",
      "economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of\n",
      "the super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them,\n",
      "there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville,\n",
      "Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population\n",
      "of the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions,\n",
      "and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly\n",
      "struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the\n",
      "disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the\n",
      "chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery\n",
      "that dictates the endless changes of alignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of\n",
      "them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder\n",
      "climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods.\n",
      "But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever\n",
      "power controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or\n",
      "Southern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of the bodies\n",
      "of scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies.\n",
      "The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status\n",
      "of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended\n",
      "like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture\n",
      "more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments,\n",
      "to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted that\n",
      "the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas.\n",
      "The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo\n",
      "and the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian\n",
      "Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by\n",
      "Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and\n",
      "Eastasia is never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim to\n",
      "enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored:\n",
      "but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the territory\n",
      "which forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate.\n",
      "Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not\n",
      "really necessary to the world's economy. They add nothing to the wealth of\n",
      "the world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and\n",
      "the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which\n",
      "to wage another war. By their labour the slave populations allow the tempo\n",
      "of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the\n",
      "structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself,\n",
      "would not be essentially different.\n",

      "The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of\n",
      "DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by\n",
      "the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the\n",
      "machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end\n",
      "of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of\n",
      "consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when\n",
      "few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not\n",
      "urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes\n",

      "still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of\n",

      "a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient--a\n",
      "glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete--was\n",
      "part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and\n",
      "technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to\n",
      "assume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly\n",
      "because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and\n",
      "revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on\n",
      "the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly\n",
      "regimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it\n",
      "was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and various\n",
      "devices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage,\n",
      "have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped,\n",
      "and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been\n",
      "fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still\n",
      "there. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it\n",
      "was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and\n",
      "therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the\n",
      "machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt,\n",
      "illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.\n",
      "And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of\n",
      "automatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible\n",
      "not to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of the\n",

      "a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were\n",
      "enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally\n",

      "basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as\n",
      "some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of\n",
      "doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency\n",
      "towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost\n",

      "of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation,\n",
      "capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were\n",
      "prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this,\n",
      "too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted\n",
      "were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was\n",
      "how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real\n",
      "wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be\n",
      "distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by\n",
      "continuous warfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives,\n",
      "but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces,\n",

      "materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,\n",
      "and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are\n",
      "not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of\n",
      "expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.\n",
      "A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that\n",
      "would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as\n",
      "obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with\n",
      "further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle\n",
      "the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might\n",
      "exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs\n",
      "of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is\n",
      "a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on\n",
      "as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups\n",
      "somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity\n",
      "increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the\n",
      "distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early\n",
      "twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere,\n",
      "laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy\n",
      "his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the\n",
      "better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three\n",

      "'the proles'. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the\n",
      "possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and\n",
      "poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and\n",
      "therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste\n",
      "seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but\n",
      "accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would\n",
      "be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building\n",
      "temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even\n",
      "by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But\n",
      "this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a\n",
      "hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses,\n",
      "whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work,\n",
      "but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is\n",
      "expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow\n",
      "limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant\n",
      "fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic\n",
      "triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality\n",
      "appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is\n",
      "actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does\n",
      "not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is\n",
      "that a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which\n",
      "the Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an\n",
      "atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks\n",
      "one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party\n",
      "that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity\n",
      "as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party\n",
      "to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often\n",
      "be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or\n",
      "is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such\n",
      "knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Meanwhile\n",
      "no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that\n",
      "the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania\n",
      "the undisputed master of the entire world.\n",
      "\n",
      "All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an\n",
      "article of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more\n",
      "and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of\n",
      "power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search\n",
      "for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining\n",
      "activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any\n",
      "outlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has\n",
      "almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for 'Science'. The\n",
      "empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of\n",
      "the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of\n",
      "Ingsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can\n",
      "in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful\n",
      "arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are\n",
      "cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery. But\n",
      "in matters of vital importance--meaning, in effect, war and police\n",
      "espionage--the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least\n",
      "tolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of\n",
      "the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent\n",
      "thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is\n",
      "concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another\n",
      "human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred\n",
      "million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. In\n",
      "so far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter.\n",
      "The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor,\n",
      "studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions,\n",
      "gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of\n",

      "physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special\n",
      "subject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories\n",
      "of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the\n",
      "Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of\n",
      "the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are\n",
      "concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise\n",
      "larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more\n",
      "and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier\n",
      "gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities\n",
      "as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease\n",
      "germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce\n",
      "a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under\n",
      "the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship;\n",
      "others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays\n",

      "producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at\n",
      "the earth's centre.\n",

      "But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none\n",
      "of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others.\n",
      "What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the\n",
      "atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present\n",
      "researches are likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its\n",
      "habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as\n",
      "early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about\n",
      "ten years later. At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on\n",
      "industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, and\n",
      "North America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all\n",
      "countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized\n",
      "society, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formal\n",
      "agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three\n",
      "powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against\n",
      "the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.\n",
      "And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or\n",
      "forty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing\n",
      "planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the\n",
      "fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating\n",
      "Fortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the\n",
      "submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand\n",
      "grenade are still in use. And in spite of the endless slaughters reported\n",
      "in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars,\n",
      "in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed\n",
      "in a few weeks, have never been repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves\n",
      "the risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is undertaken, it is\n",
      "usually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all three\n",
      "powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following,\n",
      "is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and\n",
      "well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely\n",
      "encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of\n",
      "friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years\n",
      "as to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomic\n",
      "bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all\n",
      "be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation\n",
      "impossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the\n",
      "remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it\n",
      "is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization.\n",
      "Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the\n",
      "Equator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken.\n",
      "This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the\n",
      "super-states are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the\n",
      "British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other\n",
      "hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine\n",
      "or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed on\n",
      "all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were\n",
      "to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it\n",
      "would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great\n",
      "physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred\n",
      "million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on\n",
      "the Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super-states.\n",
      "It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no\n",
      "contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners\n",
      "and coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always\n",
      "regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average\n",
      "citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or\n",
      "Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he\n",
      "were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are\n",
      "creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about\n",
      "them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the\n",
      "fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might\n",
      "evaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia,\n",
      "or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must\n",
      "never be crossed by anything except bombs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and\n",
      "acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states\n",
      "are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called\n",
      "Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is\n",
      "called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps\n",
      "better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not\n",
      "allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but\n",
      "he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and\n",
      "common sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable,\n",
      "and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all.\n",
      "Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of\n",
      "semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous\n",
      "warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer\n",
      "one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary,\n",
      "so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three\n",
      "sheaves of corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are\n",
      "simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are\n",
      "dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that\n",
      "the war should continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the\n",
      "fact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of\n",
      "reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of\n",
      "thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that\n",
      "by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or\n",
      "later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the\n",
      "past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies\n",
      "were kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried\n",
      "to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could\n",
      "not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military\n",
      "efficiency. So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other\n",
      "result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat\n",
      "had to be serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or\n",
      "religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when\n",
      "one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient\n",
      "nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for\n",
      "efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was\n",
      "necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly\n",
      "accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history\n",
      "books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of\n",
      "the kind that is practised today would have been impossible. War was a\n",
      "sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned\n",
      "it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be\n",
      "won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.\n",
      "When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity.\n",
      "Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or\n",
      "disregarded. As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific\n",
      "are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a\n",
      "kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important.\n",
      "Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing is\n",
      "efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since each of the three\n",
      "super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within\n",
      "which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised. Reality\n",
      "only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life--the need to\n",
      "eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or\n",
      "stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death,\n",
      "and between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a\n",
      "distinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world,\n",
      "and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar\n",
      "space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down.\n",
      "The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars\n",
      "could not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving\n",
      "to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged\n",
      "to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but\n",
      "once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape\n",
      "they choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is\n",
      "merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant\n",
      "animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of\n",
      "hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It\n",
      "eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the\n",
      "special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. War, it will\n",
      "be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups\n",
      "of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and\n",
      "therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another,\n",
      "and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are\n",
      "not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling\n",
      "group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make\n",
      "or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society\n",
      "intact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading. It would\n",
      "probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to\n",
      "exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the\n",
      "Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been\n",
      "replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same\n",
      "if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree\n",
      "to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For\n",
      "in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever\n",
      "from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly\n",
      "permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast\n",

      "by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside\n",
      "their daily lives--is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in\n",
      "which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is\n",
      "the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods\n",
      "the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always\n",

      "By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become\n",
      "obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who\n",
      "interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that\n",
      "inequality was the unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course,\n",
      "had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put\n",
      "forward there was a significant change. In the past the need for a\n",
      "hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the\n",
      "High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests,\n",
      "lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally\n",

      "use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however, the\n",
      "concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not\n",
      "yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the\n",
      "past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and\n",
      "then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown.\n",
      "The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand.\n",
      "Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was\n",
      "the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions\n",
      "of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages.\n",
      "But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the\n",
      "aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly\n",
      "abandoned. The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the\n",
      "century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as\n",
      "it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating\n",
      "UNfreedom and INequality. These new movements, of course, grew out of the\n",
      "old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their\n",
      "ideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze\n",
      "history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to happen once\n",
      "more, and then stop. As usual, the High were to be turned out by the\n",
      "Middle, who would then become the High; but this time, by conscious\n",

      "before the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history was now\n",
      "intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it\n",
      "was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early\n",
      "as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become\n",
      "technically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their\n",
      "native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that\n",
      "favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real\n",
      "need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlier\n",
      "ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable.\n",
      "Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machine\n",
      "production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary\n",
      "for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary\n",
      "for them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from\n",
      "the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power,\n",
      "human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to\n",
      "be averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was\n",
      "in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of\n",
      "an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of\n",
      "brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human\n",
      "imagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold\n",
      "even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The\n",
      "heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believed\n",
      "in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality\n",
      "before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be\n",
      "influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of the\n",
      "twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were\n",
      "authoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the\n",
      "moment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever\n",
      "name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the\n",
      "general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which\n",
      "had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonment\n",
      "without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions,\n",
      "torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation\n",
      "of whole populations--not only became common again, but were tolerated\n",
      "and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and\n",
      "progressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and\n",
      "counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals\n",
      "emerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been\n",
      "foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which\n",
      "had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world\n",
      "which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What\n",
      "kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. The new\n",
      "aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists,\n",
      "technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists,\n",
      "teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, whose\n",
      "origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the\n",
      "working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of\n",
      "monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their\n",
      "opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by\n",
      "luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what\n",
      "they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last\n",
      "difference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the\n",
      "tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups\n",
      "were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to\n",
      "leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be\n",
      "uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church\n",
      "of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason\n",
      "for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its\n",
      "citizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however,\n",
      "made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio\n",
      "carried the process further. With the development of television, and\n",
      "the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit\n",
      "simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every\n",
      "citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching,\n",
      "could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police\n",
      "and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of\n",
      "communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only complete\n",
      "obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion\n",
      "on all subjects, now existed for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society\n",
      "regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High\n",
      "group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what\n",
      "was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the\n",
      "only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege\n",
      "are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called\n",
      "'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years of\n",
      "the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer\n",
      "hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a\n",
      "group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the\n",
      "Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the\n",
      "Party owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and\n",
      "disposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the\n",
      "Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost\n",
      "unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of\n",
      "collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class\n",
      "were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the\n",
      "capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses,\n",
      "transport--everything had been taken away from them: and since these\n",
      "things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be\n",
      "public property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement\n",
      "and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in\n",
      "the Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand,\n",
      "that economic inequality has been made permanent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than\n",
      "this. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power.\n",
      "Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that\n",
      "the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented\n",

      "willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule\n",
      "all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could\n",
      "guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately\n",
      "the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality\n",
      "disappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in\n",
      "fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow\n",
      "demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert.\n",
      "The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never\n",
      "revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are\n",
      "oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of\n",
      "comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. The\n",
      "recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are\n",
      "not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations\n",
      "can and do happen without having political results, because there is no\n",
      "way in which discontent can become articulate. As for the problem of\n",
      "over-production, which has been latent in our society since the development\n",
      "of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare\n",
      "(see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the\n",
      "necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore,\n",
      "the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able,\n",
      "under-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and\n",
      "scepticism in their own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational.\n",
      "It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the\n",
      "directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately\n",
      "below it. The consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in\n",
      "a negative way.\n",

      "Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already,\n",
      "the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the pyramid comes\n",

      "may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already\n",
      "considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big Brother is the guise\n",
      "in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His function is\n",
      "to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which\n",
      "are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization.\n",
      "Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Its numbers limited to six\n",
      "millions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania.\n",
      "Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is\n",
      "described as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands.\n",

      "Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. The\n",
      "most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent,\n",
      "are simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated. But this\n",
      "state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of\n",
      "principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does\n",
      "not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there\n",
      "were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be\n",
      "perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of\n",

      "good-bye,' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You may as well say good-bye,' said the voice. And then another quite\n",
      "different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impression\n",
      "of having heard before, struck in; 'And by the way, while we are on the\n",
      "subject, \"Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to\n",
      "chop off your head\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston's back. The head of a ladder\n",
      "had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. Someone was\n",
      "climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs.\n",
      "The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on\n",
      "their feet and truncheons in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One\n",
      "thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them an\n",
      "excuse to hit you! A man with a smooth prize-fighter's jowl in which the\n",
      "mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon\n",
      "meditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. The\n",
      "feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face\n",
      "and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tip\n",
      "of a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, and\n",
      "then passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked up the glass\n",
      "paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from\n",
      "a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought Winston, how small it\n",
      "always was! There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a\n",
      "violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of\n",
      "the men had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling her up\n",
      "like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for\n",
      "breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes\n",
      "her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in his\n",
      "terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly\n",
      "pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her\n",
      "breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was\n",
      "there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else\n",
      "it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her\n",
      "up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack.\n",
      "Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with\n",
      "the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that\n",
      "was the last he saw of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of their\n",
      "own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his\n",
      "mind. He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what\n",
      "they had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted\n",
      "to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or\n",
      "three hours ago. He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine,\n",
      "meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light\n",
      "be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered whether\n",
      "after all he and Julia had mistaken the time--had slept the clock round\n",
      "and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty\n",
      "on the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further.\n",
      "It was not interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another, lighter step in the passage. Mr Charrington came into\n",
      "the room. The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more\n",
      "subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's appearance. His\n",
      "eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston suddenly\n",
      "realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the\n",
      "telescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but\n",
      "his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not\n",
      "wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as though\n",
      "verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He was\n",
      "still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His body\n",
      "had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone\n",
      "only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation.\n",
      "The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole\n",
      "lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It\n",
      "was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to\n",
      "Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge,\n",
      "at a member of the Thought Police.\n",

      "He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love,\n",
      "but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged\n",
      "windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps\n",
      "flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound\n",
      "which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench, or\n",
      "shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the\n",
      "door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden\n",
      "seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they\n",
      "had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was also\n",
      "hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four\n",
      "hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know,\n",
      "probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when\n",
      "they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed\n",
      "on his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpected\n",
      "movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for food\n",
      "was growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread.\n",
      "He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his\n",
      "overalls. It was even possible--he thought this because from time to time\n",
      "something seemed to tickle his leg--that there might be a sizeable bit of\n",
      "crust there. In the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he\n",
      "slipped a hand into his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Hands out of\n",
      "pockets in the cells!'\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being brought\n",
      "here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary\n",
      "prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how\n",
      "long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no\n",
      "daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling\n",
      "place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in,\n",
      "but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. The\n",
      "majority of them were common criminals, but there were a few political\n",
      "prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty\n",
      "bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much\n",
      "interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference\n",
      "in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party\n",
      "prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals\n",
      "seemed to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards,\n",
      "fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene\n",
      "words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious\n",
      "hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when\n",
      "it tried to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed to be on\n",
      "good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle\n",
      "cigarettes through the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated the\n",
      "common criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle\n",
      "them roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which\n",
      "most of the prisoners expected to be sent. It was 'all right' in the\n",
      "camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes.\n",
      "There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was\n",
      "homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilled\n",
      "from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the common\n",
      "criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort\n",
      "of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description:\n",
      "drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes.\n",
      "Some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine\n",
      "to suppress them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with\n",
      "great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down\n",
      "in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards,\n",
      "who had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with\n",
      "which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across\n",
      "Winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself\n",
      "upright and followed them out with a yell of 'F---- bastards!' Then,\n",
      "noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston's\n",
      "knees on to the bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said. 'I wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggers\n",
      "put me there. They dono 'ow to treat a lady, do they?' She paused, patted\n",
      "her breast, and belched. 'Pardon,' she said, 'I ain't meself, quite.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes. 'Never keep it\n",
      "down, thass what I say. Get it up while it's fresh on your stomach, like.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immediately\n",
      "to take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him\n",
      "towards her, breathing beer and vomit into his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Wass your name, dearie?' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Smith,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Smith?' said the woman. 'Thass funny. My name's Smith too. Why,' she\n",
      "added sentimentally, 'I might be your mother!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about the right age and\n",
      "physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty\n",
      "years in a forced-labour camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the ordinary\n",
      "criminals ignored the Party prisoners. 'The polITS,' they called them,\n",
      "with a sort of uninterested contempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified\n",
      "of speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only\n",
      "once, when two Party members, both women, were pressed close together on\n",
      "the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly-whispered\n",
      "words; and in particular a reference to something called 'room one-oh-one',\n",
      "which he did not understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. The\n",
      "dull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better and\n",
      "sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When\n",
      "it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for\n",
      "food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments\n",
      "when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality\n",
      "that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. He felt the smash of\n",
      "truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself\n",
      "grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. He\n",
      "hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved her\n",
      "and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the\n",
      "rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered\n",
      "what was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering\n",
      "hope. O'Brien might know that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood, he\n",
      "had said, never tried to save its members. But there was the razor blade;\n",
      "they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five\n",
      "seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would bite\n",
      "into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held\n",
      "it would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, which\n",
      "shrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would\n",
      "use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural to exist\n",
      "from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with the\n",
      "certainty that there was torture at the end of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the\n",
      "walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always lost count at\n",
      "some point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what time\n",
      "of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight\n",
      "outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In\n",
      "this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out.\n",
      "It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O'Brien had seemed to\n",
      "recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows. His\n",
      "cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it\n",
      "might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself\n",
      "mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his\n",
      "body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened with\n",
      "a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to\n",
      "glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured\n",
      "face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned\n",
      "to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The\n",
      "poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door clanged shut again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as\n",
      "though having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and then\n",
      "began to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston's\n",
      "presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above\n",
      "the level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were\n",
      "sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days away\n",
      "from a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving\n",
      "him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and\n",
      "nervous movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. He must speak\n",
      "to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was even\n",
      "conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ampleforth,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, mildly startled.\n",
      "His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, Smith!' he said. 'You too!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are you in for?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To tell you the truth--' He sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite\n",
      "Winston. 'There is only one offence, is there not?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And have you committed it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Apparently I have.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, as\n",
      "though trying to remember something.\n",
      "\n",
      "'These things happen,' he began vaguely. 'I have been able to recall one\n",
      "instance--a possible instance. It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. We\n",
      "were producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the\n",
      "word \"God\" to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!' he added\n",
      "almost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. 'It was impossible\n",
      "to change the line. The rhyme was \"rod\". Do you realize that there are only\n",
      "twelve rhymes to \"rod\" in the entire language? For days I had racked my\n",
      "brains. There WAS no other rhyme.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed out of it and for\n",
      "a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy\n",
      "of the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the dirt\n",
      "and scrubby hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said, 'that the whole history of English\n",
      "poetry has been determined by the fact that the English language lacks\n",
      "rhymes?'\n",
      "\n",
      "No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in the\n",
      "circumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you know what time of day it is?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ampleforth looked startled again. 'I had hardly thought about it. They\n",
      "arrested me--it could be two days ago--perhaps three.' His eyes flitted\n",
      "round the walls, as though he half expected to find a window somewhere.\n",
      "'There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not see\n",
      "how one can calculate the time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason,\n",
      "a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat quietly, his\n",
      "hands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow\n",
      "bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one\n",
      "knee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still.\n",
      "Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour--it was difficult to judge. Once more\n",
      "there was a sound of boots outside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon,\n",
      "very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would\n",
      "mean that his own turn had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell. With\n",
      "a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely\n",
      "perturbed, but uncomprehending.\n",
      "\n",
      "What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston's belly had\n",
      "revived. His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball\n",
      "falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six\n",
      "thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the\n",
      "screaming; O'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in his\n",
      "entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the wave\n",
      "of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsons\n",
      "walked into the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "'YOU here!' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor\n",
      "surprise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and down, evidently\n",
      "unable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was\n",
      "apparent that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look,\n",
      "as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the\n",
      "middle distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are you in for?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thoughtcrime!' said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone of his voice\n",
      "implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous\n",
      "horror that such a word could be applied to himself. He paused opposite\n",
      "Winston and began eagerly appealing to him: 'You don't think they'll shoot\n",
      "me, do you, old chap? They don't shoot you if you haven't actually done\n",
      "anything--only thoughts, which you can't help? I know they give you a fair\n",
      "hearing. Oh, I trust them for that! They'll know my record, won't they?\n",
      "YOU know what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of\n",
      "course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party, didn't I? I'll get\n",
      "off with five years, don't you think? Or even ten years? A chap like me\n",
      "could make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp. They wouldn't shoot me\n",
      "for going off the rails just once?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are you guilty?' said Winston.\n",

      "'Of course I'm guilty!' cried Parsons with a servile glance at the\n",
      "telescreen. 'You don't think the Party would arrest an innocent man,\n",
      "do you?' His frog-like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly\n",
      "sanctimonious expression. 'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,'\n",
      "he said sententiously. 'It's insidious. It can get hold of you without\n",
      "your even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes,\n",
      "that's a fact. There I was, working away, trying to do my bit--never knew\n",
      "I had any bad stuff in my mind at all. And then I started talking in my\n",
      "sleep. Do you know what they heard me saying?'\n",

      "\n",

      "'She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was saying, and nipped off to\n",
      "the patrols the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?\n",

      "He made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting a\n",

      "\n",
      "'Excuse me, old man,' he said. 'I can't help it. It's the waiting.'\n",

      "\n",
      "Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went, mysteriously. One, a\n",
      "woman, was consigned to 'Room 101', and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel\n",
      "and turn a different colour when she heard the words. A time came when, if\n",
      "it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if\n",
      "it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were six prisoners\n",
      "in the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat\n",
      "a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large,\n",
      "harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom\n",
      "that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food\n",
      "tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face\n",
      "and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone's eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent\n",
      "a momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking man\n",
      "who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what was\n",
      "startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because of\n",
      "its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the\n",
      "eyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or\n",
      "something.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winston\n",
      "did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as\n",
      "vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes.\n",
      "Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation.\n",
      "The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the\n",
      "cell. There was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. The\n",
      "eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, then\n",
      "turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible\n",
      "attraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up,\n",
      "waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls,\n",
      "and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the\n",
      "skull-faced man.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. The chinless man\n",
      "jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands\n",
      "behind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused\n",
      "the gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Bumstead!' roared the voice. '2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall that piece of\n",
      "bread!'\n",

      "movement.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were quivering\n",
      "uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the young officer entered and\n",
      "stepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with\n",
      "enormous arms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man,\n",
      "and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with\n",
      "all the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man's mouth.\n",
      "The force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. His body\n",
      "was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory\n",
      "seat. For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from\n",
      "his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed\n",
      "unconscious, came out of him. Then he rolled over and raised himself\n",
      "unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two\n",
      "halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. The\n",
      "chinless man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face the\n",
      "flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured\n",
      "mass with a black hole in the middle of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls.\n",
      "His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever,\n",
      "as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for\n",
      "his humiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated the\n",
      "skull-faced man.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side. The man had actually\n",
      "flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his hand clasped together.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Comrade! Officer!' he cried. 'You don't have to take me to that place!\n",
      "Haven't I told you everything already? What else is it you want to know?\n",
      "There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing! Just tell me what it is and\n",
      "I'll confess straight off. Write it down and I'll sign it--anything!\n",
      "Not room 101!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' said the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not have\n",
      "believed possible. It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do anything to me!' he yelled. 'You've been starving me for weeks. Finish\n",
      "it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five\n",
      "years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is\n",
      "and I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do\n",
      "to them. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn't six\n",
      "years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in\n",
      "front of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' said the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though with\n",
      "some idea that he could put another victim in his own place. His eyes\n",
      "settled on the smashed face of the chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's the one you ought to be taking, not me!' he shouted. 'You didn't\n",
      "hear what he was saying after they bashed his face. Give me a chance and\n",
      "I'll tell you every word of it. HE'S the one that's against the Party, not\n",
      "me.' The guards stepped forward. The man's voice rose to a shriek. 'You\n",
      "didn't hear him!' he repeated. 'Something went wrong with the telescreen.\n",
      "HE'S the one you want. Take him, not me!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just at\n",
      "this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one\n",
      "of the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless\n",
      "howling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose,\n",
      "but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds\n",
      "they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on\n",
      "their knees, looking straight in front of them. The howling stopped; the\n",
      "man had no breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was a\n",
      "different kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingers\n",
      "of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' said the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his\n",
      "crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was\n",
      "taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston was\n",
      "alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow\n",
      "bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the\n",
      "telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had\n",
      "dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it,\n",
      "but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky and\n",
      "evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a\n",
      "sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get up\n",
      "because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit\n",
      "down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of\n",
      "staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little under\n",
      "control the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of\n",
      "O'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might\n",
      "arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought\n",
      "of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he.\n",
      "She might be screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: 'If I could\n",
      "save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.' But that\n",
      "was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought\n",
      "to take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything,\n",
      "except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you\n",
      "were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain\n",
      "should increase? But that question was not answerable yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all\n",
      "caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the\n",
      "presence of the telescreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They've got you too!' he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful\n",
      "irony. He stepped aside. From behind him there emerged a broad-chested\n",
      "guard with a long black truncheon in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien. 'Don't deceive yourself. You did\n",
      "know it--you have always known it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of\n",
      "that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand. It might\n",
      "fall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on\n",
      "the elbow----\n",
      "\n",
      "The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping the\n",
      "stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded into yellow\n",
      "light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!\n",
      "The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The\n",
      "guard was laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate was\n",
      "answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase\n",
      "of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop.\n",
      "Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain\n",
      "there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed\n",
      "on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.\n",

      "He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was\n",
      "higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he\n",
      "could not move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his\n",
      "face. O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At\n",
      "the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic\n",
      "syringe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually.\n",
      "He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite\n",
      "different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he\n",
      "had been down there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested\n",
      "him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not\n",
      "continuous. There had been times when consciousness, even the sort of\n",
      "consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again\n",
      "after a blank interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks\n",
      "or only seconds, there was no way of knowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. Later he was\n",
      "to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine\n",
      "interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a\n",
      "long range of crimes--espionage, sabotage, and the like--to which everyone\n",
      "had to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality,\n",
      "though the torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how long\n",
      "the beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were five\n",
      "or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was\n",
      "fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes\n",
      "it was boots. There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless\n",
      "as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless\n",
      "effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks,\n",
      "in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin,\n",
      "in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times\n",
      "when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed\n",
      "to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not\n",
      "force himself into losing consciousness. There were times when his nerve\n",
      "so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating\n",
      "began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough\n",
      "to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There\n",
      "were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing\n",
      "nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of\n",
      "pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he\n",
      "said to himself: 'I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the\n",
      "pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will\n",
      "tell them what they want.' Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly\n",
      "stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell,\n",
      "left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again.\n",
      "There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly,\n",
      "because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cell\n",
      "with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin\n",
      "wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. He\n",
      "remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair,\n",
      "and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse,\n",
      "tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over\n",
      "him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make\n",
      "him sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror\n",
      "to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were\n",
      "unsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms\n",
      "but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and\n",
      "flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which\n",
      "lasted--he thought, he could not be sure--ten or twelve hours at a stretch.\n",
      "These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but\n",
      "it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung\n",
      "his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to\n",
      "urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water;\n",
      "but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of\n",
      "arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioning\n",
      "that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for\n",
      "him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of\n",
      "lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as\n",
      "from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a\n",
      "single session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened\n",
      "at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes\n",
      "they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in\n",
      "the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even\n",
      "now he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to\n",
      "undo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of\n",
      "questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. In the\n",
      "end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and\n",
      "fists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that\n",
      "signed, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find out\n",
      "what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the\n",
      "bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Party\n",
      "members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public\n",
      "funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that\n",
      "he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as\n",
      "1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of\n",
      "capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his\n",
      "wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife\n",
      "was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch\n",
      "with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which\n",
      "had included almost every human being he had ever known. It was easier to\n",
      "confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all\n",
      "true. It was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes\n",
      "of the Party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also memories of another kind. They stood out in his mind\n",
      "disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he\n",
      "could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of\n",
      "instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more\n",
      "luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and\n",
      "was swallowed up.\n",

      "He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights.\n",

      "laughter. Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had\n",
      "somehow been skipped over and had not happened. Everything was all right,\n",
      "there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare,\n",
      "understood, forgiven.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had\n",
      "heard O'Brien's voice. All through his interrogation, although he had\n",
      "never seen him, he had had the feeling that O'Brien was at his elbow, just\n",
      "out of sight. It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who\n",
      "set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It\n",
      "was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should\n",
      "have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the\n",
      "drugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and\n",
      "suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was\n",
      "the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once--Winston could not remember\n",
      "whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment\n",
      "of wakefulness--a voice murmured in his ear: 'Don't worry, Winston; you\n",
      "are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now the\n",
      "turning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you perfect.' He\n",
      "was not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voice\n",
      "that had said to him, 'We shall meet in the place where there is no\n",
      "darkness,' in that other dream, seven years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period of\n",
      "blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually\n",
      "materialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move.\n",
      "His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head\n",
      "was gripped in some manner. O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and\n",
      "rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with\n",
      "pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older\n",
      "than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under\n",
      "his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round\n",
      "the face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I told you,' said O'Brien, 'that if we met again it would be here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien's hand, a wave of\n",
      "pain flooded his body. It was a frightening pain, because he could not see\n",
      "what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was\n",
      "being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening,\n",
      "or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being\n",
      "wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although\n",
      "the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was\n",
      "the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and\n",
      "breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are afraid,' said O'Brien, watching his face, 'that in another moment\n",
      "something is going to break. Your especial fear is that it will be your\n",
      "backbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart\n",
      "and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking,\n",
      "is it not, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston did not answer. O'Brien drew back the lever on the dial. The wave\n",
      "of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That was forty,' said O'Brien. 'You can see that the numbers on this dial\n",
      "run up to a hundred. Will you please remember, throughout our conversation,\n",
      "that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to\n",
      "whatever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to\n",
      "prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level of\n",
      "intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understand\n",
      "that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien's manner became less severe. He resettled his spectacles\n",
      "thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. When he spoke his voice\n",
      "was gentle and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a\n",
      "priest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' he said, 'because you are worth\n",
      "trouble. You know perfectly well what is the matter with you. You have\n",
      "known it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. You are\n",
      "mentally deranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable to\n",
      "remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other\n",
      "events which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have never\n",
      "cured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was a small\n",
      "effort of the will that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well\n",
      "aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is\n",
      "a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, which power is\n",
      "Oceania at war with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia,\n",
      "has it not?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak and then did not\n",
      "speak. He could not take his eyes away from the dial.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what you think you\n",
      "remember.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not at\n",
      "war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance with them. The war was\n",
      "against Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. Before that----'\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Another example,' he said. 'Some years ago you had a very serious delusion\n",
      "indeed. You believed that three men, three one-time Party members named\n",
      "Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--men who were executed for treachery and\n",
      "sabotage after making the fullest possible confession--were not guilty of\n",
      "the crimes they were charged with. You believed that you had seen\n",
      "unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were\n",
      "false. There was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination.\n",
      "You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It was a\n",
      "photograph something like this.'\n",
      "\n",
      "An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For\n",
      "perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was\n",
      "a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was THE\n",
      "photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and\n",
      "Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon\n",
      "eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before\n",
      "his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it,\n",
      "unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to\n",
      "wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as\n",
      "a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the\n",
      "dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at\n",
      "least to see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It exists!' he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall.\n",
      "O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling\n",
      "away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.\n",
      "O'Brien turned away from the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ashes,' he said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist.\n",
      "It never existed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it.\n",
      "You remember it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly\n",
      "helplessness. If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying, it\n",
      "would not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien\n",
      "had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have\n",
      "forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of\n",
      "forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps\n",
      "that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the\n",
      "thought that defeated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than ever he had the\n",
      "air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past,' he said.\n",
      "'Repeat it, if you please.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present\n",
      "controls the past,\"' repeated Winston obediently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Who controls the present controls the past,\"' said O'Brien, nodding his\n",
      "head with slow approval. 'Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past has\n",
      "real existence?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. His eyes flitted\n",
      "towards the dial. He not only did not know whether 'yes' or 'no' was the\n",
      "answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he\n",
      "believed to be the true one.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said.\n",
      "'Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. I\n",
      "will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Is\n",
      "there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past\n",
      "is still happening?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then where does the past exist, if at all?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In records. It is written down.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In records. And----?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In the mind. In human memories.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we\n",
      "control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But how can you stop people remembering things?' cried Winston again\n",
      "momentarily forgetting the dial. 'It is involuntary. It is outside oneself.\n",
      "How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!'\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien's manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the dial.\n",
      "\n",
      "'On the contrary,' he said, 'YOU have not controlled it. That is what has\n",
      "brought you here. You are here because you have failed in humility, in\n",
      "self-discipline. You would not make the act of submission which is the\n",
      "price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the\n",
      "disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is\n",
      "something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe\n",
      "that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into\n",
      "thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the\n",
      "same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.\n",
      "Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual\n",
      "mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the\n",
      "mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party\n",
      "holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by\n",
      "looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got\n",
      "to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the\n",
      "will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying to\n",
      "sink in.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you remember,' he went on, 'writing in your diary, \"Freedom is the\n",
      "freedom to say that two plus two make four\"?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb\n",
      "hidden and the four fingers extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And if the party says that it is not four but five--then how many?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up to\n",
      "fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's body. The air tore\n",
      "into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his\n",
      "teeth he could not stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still\n",
      "extended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly\n",
      "eased.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The needle went up to sixty.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. The heavy,\n",
      "stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. The fingers stood up\n",
      "before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate,\n",
      "but unmistakably four.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Five! Five! Five!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think there are\n",
      "four. How many fingers, please?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round his shoulders. He had\n",
      "perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds that had held his\n",
      "body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably,\n",
      "his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For a\n",
      "moment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy\n",
      "arm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that O'Brien was his protector,\n",
      "that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source,\n",
      "and that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said O'Brien gently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How can I help it?' he blubbered. 'How can I help seeing what is in front\n",
      "of my eyes? Two and two are four.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three.\n",
      "Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not\n",
      "easy to become sane.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again,\n",
      "but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him\n",
      "merely weak and cold. O'Brien motioned with his head to the man in the\n",
      "white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in\n",
      "the white coat bent down and looked closely into Winston's eyes, felt his\n",
      "pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then he\n",
      "nodded to O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Again,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pain flowed into Winston's body. The needle must be at seventy,\n",
      "seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He knew that the fingers\n",
      "were still there, and still four. All that mattered was somehow to stay\n",
      "alive until the spasm was over. He had ceased to notice whether he was\n",
      "crying out or not. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O'Brien\n",
      "had drawn back the lever.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could. I am trying\n",
      "to see five.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or really to see\n",
      "them?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Really to see them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Again,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the needle was eighty--ninety. Winston could not intermittently\n",
      "remember why the pain was happening. Behind his screwed-up eyelids a\n",
      "forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and\n",
      "out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying\n",
      "to count them, he could not remember why. He knew only that it was\n",
      "impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious\n",
      "identity between five and four. The pain died down again. When he opened\n",
      "his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing.\n",
      "Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past in\n",
      "either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know. I don't know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four,\n",
      "five, six--in all honesty I don't know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Better,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "A needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful,\n",
      "healing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was already\n",
      "half-forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien.\n",
      "At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart\n",
      "seemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out\n",
      "a hand and laid it on O'Brien's arm. He had never loved him so deeply as\n",
      "at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The old\n",
      "feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friend\n",
      "or an enemy, had come back. O'Brien was a person who could be talked to.\n",
      "Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brien\n",
      "had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was\n",
      "certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some\n",
      "sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or\n",
      "other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place\n",
      "where they could meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with an\n",
      "expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.\n",
      "When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you know how long you have been here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know. Days, weeks, months--I think it is months.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To make them confess.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, that is not the reason. Try again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To punish them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No!' exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his\n",
      "face had suddenly become both stern and animated. 'No! Not merely to\n",
      "extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have\n",
      "brought you here? To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand,\n",
      "Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands\n",
      "uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have\n",
      "committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is\n",
      "all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.\n",
      "Do you understand what I mean by that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was bending over Winston. His face looked enormous because of its\n",
      "nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below. Moreover it\n",
      "was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston's\n",
      "heart shrank. If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into\n",
      "the bed. He felt certain that O'Brien was about to twist the dial out of\n",
      "sheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O'Brien turned away. He took a\n",
      "pace or two up and down. Then he continued less vehemently:\n",
      "\n",
      "'The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no\n",
      "martyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In\n",
      "the Middle Ages there was the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set out\n",
      "to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it\n",
      "burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because\n",
      "the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while\n",
      "they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were\n",
      "unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true\n",
      "beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame\n",
      "to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there\n",
      "were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis\n",
      "and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly\n",
      "than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned\n",
      "from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not\n",
      "make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they\n",
      "deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down\n",
      "by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches,\n",
      "confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with\n",
      "abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy.\n",
      "And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again.\n",
      "The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once\n",
      "again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they\n",
      "had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of\n",
      "that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make\n",
      "them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us.\n",
      "You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston.\n",
      "Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the\n",
      "stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the\n",
      "stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not\n",
      "a memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past as well\n",
      "as in the future. You will never have existed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary\n",
      "bitterness. O'Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the\n",
      "thought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little\n",
      "narrowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to destroy you utterly,\n",
      "so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference--in\n",
      "that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? That is\n",
      "what you were thinking, was it not?'\n",

      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien smiled slightly. 'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are\n",
      "a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are\n",
      "different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with\n",
      "negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally\n",
      "you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy\n",
      "the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never\n",
      "destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him.\n",
      "We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our\n",
      "side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of\n",
      "ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous\n",
      "thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless\n",
      "it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In\n",
      "the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming\n",
      "his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could\n",
      "carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage\n",
      "waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it\n",
      "out. The command of the old despotisms was \"Thou shalt not\". The command\n",
      "of the totalitarians was \"Thou shalt\". Our command is \"THOU ART\". No one\n",
      "whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed\n",
      "clean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once\n",
      "believed--Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--in the end we broke them down.\n",
      "I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down,\n",
      "whimpering, grovelling, weeping--and in the end it was not with pain or\n",
      "fear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they were\n",
      "only the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for\n",
      "what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to see\n",
      "how they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die\n",
      "while their minds were still clean.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm,\n",
      "was still in his face. He is not pretending, thought Winston, he is not a\n",
      "hypocrite, he believes every word he says. What most oppressed him was the\n",
      "consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavy\n",
      "yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his\n",
      "vision. O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was no\n",
      "idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O'Brien had not long ago\n",
      "known, examined, and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston's mind. But\n",
      "in that case how could it be true that O'Brien was mad? It must be he,\n",

      "you would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever.\n",
      "Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the point from\n",
      "which there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which you\n",
      "could not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you be\n",
      "capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you.\n",
      "Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living,\n",
      "or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow.\n",

      "At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an\n",
      "explosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. There\n",

      "prostrated. Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing\n",
      "happened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that\n",
      "position. A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also something\n",
      "had happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus he\n",
      "remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that was\n",
      "gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of\n",
      "emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.\n",

      "you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you\n",

      "recognize her if you saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her\n",
      "folly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her. It was\n",

      "\n",
      "'You do not exist,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, or he could\n",
      "imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were\n",
      "nonsense, they were only a play on words. Did not the statement, 'You do\n",
      "not exist', contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so?\n",
      "His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with\n",
      "which O'Brien would demolish him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I think I exist,' he said wearily. 'I am conscious of my own identity.\n",
      "I was born and I shall die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particular\n",

      "as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still had\n",
      "not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. He had got\n",
      "to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. There\n",
      "was a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed to\n",
      "wear an ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he knows what\n",
      "I am going to ask! At the thought the words burst out of him:\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is in Room 101?'\n",
      "\n",

      "Room 101.'\n",

      "you to enter upon the second stage.'\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds were\n",
      "looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a\n",
      "little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from\n",
      "the elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could\n",
      "evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he\n",
      "showed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through\n",
      "a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many\n",
      "sessions there had been. The whole process seemed to stretch out over a\n",
      "long, indefinite time--weeks, possibly--and the intervals between the\n",

      "asked me--why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble\n",
      "on you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially\n",
      "the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived\n",
      "in, but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary,\n",
      "\"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY\"? It was when you thought about\n",
      "\"why\" that you doubted your own sanity. You have read THE BOOK,\n",

      "'As description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secret\n",
      "accumulation of knowledge--a gradual spread of enlightenment--ultimately\n",
      "a proletarian rebellion--the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself\n",
      "that that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians will\n",

      "the Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me WHY we cling to power.\n",
      "What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' he added as\n",
      "Winston remained silent.\n",

      "Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of\n",
      "weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come\n",
      "back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. That\n",
      "the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of\n",
      "the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail,\n",
      "cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and\n",
      "must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger\n",
      "than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and\n",
      "happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.\n",
      "That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect\n",
      "doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of\n",
      "others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that\n",

      "the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings\n",
      "lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had\n",
      "understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was\n",
      "justified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston,\n",
      "against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your\n",
      "arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?\n",
      "\n",

      "O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party\n",

      "life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will\n",
      "understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the\n",
      "past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who\n",
      "resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the\n",
      "Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never\n",
      "had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps\n",
      "they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a\n",
      "limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where\n",
      "human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that\n",

      "decay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual\n",
      "is only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism.\n",
      "Do you die when you cut your fingernails?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one hand\n",
      "in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We are the priests of power,' he said. 'God is power. But at present\n",
      "power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to\n",
      "gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realize\n",
      "is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as\n",
      "he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: \"Freedom is\n",
      "Slavery\". Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is\n",
      "freedom. Alone--free--the human being is always defeated. It must be so,\n",
      "because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all\n",
      "failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape\n",
      "from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS the\n",
      "Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to\n",
      "realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body--but, above\n",
      "all, over the mind. Power over matter--external reality, as you would call\n",
      "it--is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise\n",
      "himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his\n",
      "body painfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'You don't even control\n",
      "the climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death----'\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'We control matter because\n",
      "we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn by\n",
      "degrees, Winston. There is nothing that we could not do. Invisibility,\n",
      "levitation--anything. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if\n",
      "I wish to. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You must\n",
      "get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature. We\n",
      "make the laws of Nature.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What about\n",
      "Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not,\n",
      "what difference would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceania\n",
      "is the world.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny--helpless!\n",
      "How long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was\n",
      "uninhabited.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older?\n",
      "Nothing exists except through human consciousness.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals--mammoths and\n",

      "heard of.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-century\n",
      "biologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if he\n",
      "could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is\n",
      "nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of them are\n",
      "a million light-years away. They are out of our reach for ever.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They are bits of fire\n",
      "a few kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could\n",
      "blot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the\n",
      "stars go round it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say\n",
      "anything. O'Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection:\n",
      "\n",
      "'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the\n",
      "ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to\n",
      "assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions\n",
      "upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is\n",
      "beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near\n",
      "or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians\n",
      "are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer\n",
      "crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he KNEW, that he was in the\n",
      "right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind--surely there\n",
      "must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been\n",
      "exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he\n",
      "had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of O'Brien's mouth as\n",
      "he looked down at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I told you, Winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is not your strong\n",
      "point. The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are\n",
      "mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But\n",
      "that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a\n",
      "digression,' he added in a different tone. 'The real power, the power we\n",
      "have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.'\n",
      "He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster\n",
      "questioning a promising pupil: 'How does one man assert his power over\n",
      "another, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is\n",
      "suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his\n",
      "own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing\n",
      "human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of\n",
      "your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are\n",
      "creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that\n",
      "the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a\n",
      "world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not\n",
      "less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will\n",
      "be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they\n",
      "were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world\n",
      "there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.\n",
      "Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down\n",
      "the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We\n",
      "have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and\n",
      "between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend\n",
      "any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends.\n",
      "Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from\n",
      "a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual\n",
      "formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm.\n",
      "Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except\n",
      "loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of\n",
      "Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over\n",
      "a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When\n",
      "we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be\n",
      "no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity,\n",
      "no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be\n",
      "destroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be\n",
      "the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing\n",
      "subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory,\n",
      "the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a\n",
      "picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to\n",
      "shrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything.\n",
      "His heart seemed to be frozen. O'Brien went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "'And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to be\n",
      "stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so\n",
      "that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you\n",
      "have undergone since you have been in our hands--all that will continue,\n",
      "and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the\n",
      "executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of\n",
      "terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the\n",
      "less it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter the\n",
      "despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at\n",
      "every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and\n",
      "yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you\n",
      "during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after\n",
      "generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here\n",
      "at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible--and in the end\n",
      "utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own\n",

      "I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you\n",

      "conversation he had had with O'Brien, on the night when he had enrolled\n",
      "himself in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal,\n",
      "to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to\n",
      "disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child's face. O'Brien\n",

      "spirit. You shall see yourself as you are. Take off your clothes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. The zip\n",
      "fastener had long since been wrenched out of them. He could not remember\n",
      "whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at\n",
      "one time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish\n",
      "rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid\n",
      "them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far\n",
      "end of the room. He approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry\n",
      "had broken out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Go on,' said O'Brien. 'Stand between the wings of the mirror. You shall\n",
      "see the side view as well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, grey-coloured,\n",
      "skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was\n",
      "frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He\n",
      "moved closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded,\n",
      "because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby\n",
      "forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and\n",
      "battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful.\n",
      "The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was\n",
      "his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had\n",
      "changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the\n",
      "ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he had\n",
      "thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was\n",
      "grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all\n",
      "over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there\n",
      "were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an\n",
      "inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening\n",
      "thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow\n",
      "as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker\n",
      "than the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant about seeing the side\n",
      "view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders were\n",
      "hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck\n",
      "seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he\n",
      "would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from\n",
      "some malignant disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You have thought sometimes,' said O'Brien, 'that my face--the face of a\n",
      "member of the Inner Party--looks old and worn. What do you think of your\n",
      "own face?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He seized Winston's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Look at the condition you are in!' he said. 'Look at this filthy grime\n",
      "all over your body. Look at the dirt between your toes. Look at that\n",
      "disgusting running sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink like a\n",
      "goat? Probably you have ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do\n",
      "you see? I can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. I could\n",
      "snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost twenty-five\n",
      "kilograms since you have been in our hands? Even your hair is coming out\n",
      "in handfuls. Look!' He plucked at Winston's head and brought away a tuft\n",
      "of hair. 'Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many had you\n",
      "when you came to us? And the few you have left are dropping out of your\n",
      "head. Look here!'\n",
      "\n",
      "He seized one of Winston's remaining front teeth between his powerful\n",
      "thumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain shot through Winston's jaw. O'Brien\n",
      "had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the\n",
      "cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are rotting away,' he said; 'you are falling to pieces. What are you?\n",
      "A bag of filth. Now turn around and look into that mirror again. Do you\n",
      "see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that is\n",
      "humanity. Now put your clothes on again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. Until now he had\n",
      "not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. Only one thought stirred in\n",
      "his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined.\n",
      "Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of\n",
      "pity for his ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing\n",
      "he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst\n",
      "into tears. He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of\n",
      "bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but\n",
      "he could not stop himself. O'Brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almost\n",
      "kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It will not last for ever,' he said. 'You can escape from it whenever you\n",
      "choose. Everything depends on yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You did it!' sobbed Winston. 'You reduced me to this state.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you accepted when\n",
      "you set yourself up against the Party. It was all contained in that first\n",
      "act. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, and then went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "'We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen what\n",
      "your body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there\n",
      "can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and\n",
      "insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in\n",
      "your own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed\n",
      "everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that has\n",
      "not happened to you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his\n",
      "eyes. He looked up at O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I have not betrayed Julia,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'No,' he said; 'no; that is\n",
      "perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy,\n",
      "flooded Winston's heart again. How intelligent, he thought, how\n",
      "intelligent! Never did O'Brien fail to understand what was said to him.\n",
      "Anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he HAD betrayed\n",
      "Julia. For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the\n",
      "torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her\n",
      "character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail\n",
      "everything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said to\n",
      "her and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, their\n",
      "vague plottings against the Party--everything. And yet, in the sense in\n",
      "which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. He had not stopped\n",
      "loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. O'Brien had\n",

      "By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no\n",

      "strength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there,\n",
      "trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were\n",
      "growing rounder and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a\n",
      "doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker\n",

      "measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing\n",
      "straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and\n",
      "humiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of a\n",
      "walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand\n",
      "on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and found\n",
      "that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to\n",
      "a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight\n",

      "let such an outburst go unpunished. They would know now, if they had not\n",
      "known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them.\n",
      "He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had\n",
      "hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had\n",
      "retreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped\n",
      "to keep the inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but\n",
      "he preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand that--O'Brien would\n",
      "understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would have to start all over again. It might take years. He ran a hand\n",
      "over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. There\n",
      "were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose\n",
      "flattened. Besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been\n",
      "given a complete new set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve\n",
      "inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. In any\n",
      "case, mere control of the features was not enough. For the first time he\n",
      "perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from\n",
      "yourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but until it is\n",
      "needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape\n",
      "that could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right;\n",
      "he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred\n",
      "locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and\n",
      "yet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would\n",
      "happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. It\n",
      "was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be\n",
      "enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then\n",
      "suddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the\n",
      "changing of a line in his face--suddenly the camouflage would be down and\n",
      "bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an\n",
      "enormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go the\n",
      "bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown his brain to pieces\n",
      "before they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be unpunished,\n",
      "unrepented, out of their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole in\n",
      "their own perfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an intellectual\n",
      "discipline. It was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. He\n",
      "had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. What was the most horrible,\n",
      "sickening thing of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face\n",

      "being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that\n",

      "were below ground level. The room where he had been interrogated by\n",

      "\n",
      "It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed\n",

      "straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a\n",
      "metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was\n",
      "strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not\n",

      "\n",
      "The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire,\n",
      "a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table. Because\n",
      "of the position in which O'Brien was standing. Winston could not see what\n",
      "the thing was.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, 'varies from individual to\n",
      "individual. It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, or\n",
      "by impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is some\n",

      "\n",
      "He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of\n",
      "the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top\n",
      "for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked\n",
      "like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three\n",
      "or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided\n",
      "lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature\n",
      "in each. They were rats.\n",

      "roaring sound in your ears. There was something terrible on the other side\n",
      "of the wall. You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it\n",

      "He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with\n",
      "sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances.\n",
      "Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They were\n",

      "That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.\n",

      "There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear himself\n",
      "loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head,\n",

      "he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a\n",
      "split second left--to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty\n",
      "odour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of\n",
      "nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had gone\n",
      "black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out\n",
      "of the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one way to save\n",
      "himself. He must interpose another human being, the BODY of another human\n",
      "being, between himself and the rats.\n",
      "\n",

      "hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see\n",

      "Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) was moving southward at\n",
      "terrifying speed. The mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite\n",

      "The stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting\n",
      "enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; and\n",
      "what was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him\n",

      "out of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming\n",
      "across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa\n",
      "like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank them in\n",
      "some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in his\n",
      "mind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. THERE\n",
      "was the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward he\n",
      "saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear,\n",
      "cutting their communications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he\n",
      "was bringing that other force into existence. But it was necessary to act\n",
      "quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they had\n",
      "airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It\n",
      "might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the\n",

      "The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for the\n",

      "froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to\n",
      "the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew\n",
      "now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long\n",
      "scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that\n",
      "was not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a\n",
      "surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion\n",
      "of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and\n",
      "had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by\n",
      "its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone\n",
      "than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture\n",
      "of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked back\n",
      "across the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time. It\n",
      "was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered\n",
      "whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it\n",
      "was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept\n",
      "squeezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by side\n",
      "but not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak. She moved\n",
      "her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig. Her\n",
      "feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet\n",
      "the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984\n",
      "there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of\n",
      "communication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in\n",
      "'The Times' were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could\n",
      "only be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would\n",
      "have finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should\n",
      "call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all\n",
      "Party members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions\n",
      "more and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and\n",
      "embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was\n",
      "a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic\n",
      "formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final,\n",
      "perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary,\n",
      "that we are concerned here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression\n",
      "for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc,\n",
      "but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that\n",
      "when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,\n",
      "a heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles of\n",
      "Ingsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is\n",
      "dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and\n",
      "often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could\n",
      "properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the\n",
      "possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly\n",
      "by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable\n",
      "words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and\n",
      "so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single\n",
      "example. The word FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be\n",
      "used in such statements as 'This dog is free from lice' or 'This field is\n",
      "free from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of 'politically\n",
      "free' or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom no\n",
      "longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.\n",
      "Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction\n",
      "of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be\n",
      "dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend\n",
      "but to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly\n",
      "assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though\n",
      "many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,\n",
      "would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak\n",
      "words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary,\n",
      "the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary.\n",
      "It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical\n",
      "peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to\n",
      "the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the\n",
      "business of everyday life--for such things as eating, drinking, working,\n",
      "putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles,\n",
      "gardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words\n",
      "that we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE,\n",
      "FIELD--but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their\n",
      "number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly\n",
      "defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of\n",
      "them. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was\n",
      "simply a staccato sound expressing ONE clearly understood concept. It\n",
      "would have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary\n",
      "purposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intended\n",
      "only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete\n",
      "objects or physical actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of\n",
      "these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of\n",
      "speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very\n",
      "abstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun,\n",
      "adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were\n",
      "of the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself\n",
      "involving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, for\n",
      "example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by THINK, which\n",
      "did duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed\n",
      "here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention,\n",
      "in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning\n",
      "were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently\n",
      "suppressed. There was, for example, no such word as CUT, its meaning being\n",
      "sufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by\n",
      "adding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE. Thus\n",
      "for example, SPEEDFUL meant 'rapid' and SPEEDWISE meant 'quickly'. Certain\n",
      "of our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT,\n",
      "were retained, but their total number was very small. There was little\n",
      "need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by\n",
      "adding -FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained,\n",
      "except for a very few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination was\n",
      "invariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, any word--this again applied in principle to every word in\n",
      "the language--could be negatived by adding the affix UN-, or could be\n",
      "strengthened by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis,\n",
      "DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example, UNCOLD meant 'warm', while PLUSCOLD and\n",
      "DOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, 'very cold' and 'superlatively cold'.\n",
      "It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of\n",
      "almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-,\n",
      "etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous\n",
      "diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was no\n",
      "need for such a word as BAD, since the required meaning was equally\n",
      "well--indeed, better--expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in any\n",
      "case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide\n",
      "which of them to suppress. DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT,\n",
      "or LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.\n",
      "Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions\n",
      "followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past\n",
      "participle were the same and ended in -ED. The preterite of STEAL was\n",
      "STEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so on throughout the\n",
      "language, all such forms as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being\n",
      "abolished. All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might be.\n",
      "The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES. Comparison of\n",
      "adjectives was invariably made by adding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST),\n",
      "irregular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being suppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly\n",
      "were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the\n",
      "auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that\n",
      "WHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had\n",
      "been dropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD. There were\n",
      "also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for\n",
      "rapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable\n",
      "to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally\n",
      "therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word\n",
      "or an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt\n",
      "chiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary. WHY so great an importance was\n",
      "attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been\n",
      "deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say,\n",
      "which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended\n",
      "to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without\n",
      "a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use\n",
      "these words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into\n",
      "Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually\n",
      "demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain\n",
      "overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing\n",
      "whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more\n",
      "accurate and forcible than ordinary language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B words were in all cases compound words. [Compound words such as\n",
      "SPEAKWRITE, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were\n",
      "merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.]\n",
      "They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together\n",
      "in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a\n",
      "noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single\n",
      "example: the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, if\n",
      "one chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'. This\n",
      "inflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK; past tense and past participle,\n",
      "GOODTHINKED; present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOODTHINKFUL;\n",
      "adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, GOODTHINKER.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of\n",
      "which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed\n",
      "in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce\n",
      "while indicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime),\n",
      "for instance, the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police)\n",
      "it came first, and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.\n",
      "Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations\n",
      "were commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example,\n",
      "the adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,\n",
      "MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because -TRUEFUL,\n",
      "-PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle,\n",
      "however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the\n",
      "same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to\n",
      "anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example,\n",
      "such a typical sentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERS\n",
      "UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could make of this\n",
      "in Oldspeak would be: 'Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution\n",
      "cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English\n",
      "Socialism.' But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, in\n",
      "order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above,\n",
      "one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by INGSOC. And in\n",
      "addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate\n",
      "the full force of the word BELLYFEEL, which implied a blind, enthusiastic\n",
      "acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word OLDTHINK, which was\n",
      "inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the\n",
      "special function of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK was one,\n",
      "was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words,\n",
      "necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they\n",
      "contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were\n",
      "sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped\n",
      "and forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak\n",
      "Dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make\n",
      "sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words\n",
      "they cancelled by their existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have already seen in the case of the word FREE, words which had\n",
      "once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of\n",
      "convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them.\n",
      "Countless other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY, INTERNATIONALISM,\n",
      "DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and RELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket\n",
      "words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words\n",
      "grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for\n",
      "instance, were contained in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all words\n",
      "grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism\n",
      "were contained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater precision would have\n",
      "been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar\n",
      "to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that\n",
      "all nations other than his own worshipped 'false gods'. He did not need to\n",
      "know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the\n",
      "like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy.\n",
      "He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that\n",
      "all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat\n",
      "the same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in\n",
      "exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from\n",
      "it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by\n",
      "the two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity).\n",
      "SEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication,\n",
      "adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal\n",
      "intercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate\n",
      "them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle,\n",
      "all punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific\n",
      "and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to\n",
      "certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them.\n",
      "He knew what was meant by GOODSEX--that is to say, normal intercourse\n",
      "between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and\n",
      "without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was SEXCRIME.\n",
      "In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further\n",
      "than the perception that it WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessary\n",
      "words were nonexistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were\n",
      "euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) or\n",
      "MINIPAX (Ministry of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact\n",
      "opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand,\n",
      "displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of\n",
      "Oceanic society. An example was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy\n",
      "entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses.\n",
      "Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation 'good' when\n",
      "applied to the Party and 'bad' when applied to its enemies. But in\n",
      "addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared\n",
      "to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not\n",
      "from their meaning, but from their structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have\n",

      "shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number\n",
      "of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. In the Ministry\n",

      "cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it.\n",
      "The words COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up a composite\n",
      "picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx,\n",
      "and the Paris Commune. The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests\n",

      "It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in\n",
      "purpose, as a chair or a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be uttered\n",
      "almost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase\n",
      "over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way,\n",
      "the associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and more\n",
      "controllable than those called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not\n",
      "only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the\n",
      "almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily\n",
      "pronounceable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude\n",
      "of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it\n",
      "seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for\n",
      "political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which\n",
      "could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the\n",
      "speaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from\n",
      "the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably\n",
      "these words--GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC,\n",
      "BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, and countless others--were words of two or three\n",
      "syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable\n",
      "and the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at\n",
      "once staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The\n",
      "intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not\n",
      "ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.\n",
      "For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes\n",
      "necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to\n",
      "make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the\n",
      "correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets.\n",
      "His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost\n",
      "foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound\n",
      "and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of\n",
      "Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our\n",
      "own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were\n",
      "constantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other\n",
      "languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every\n",
      "year. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice,\n",
      "the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to\n",
      "make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher\n",
      "brain centres at all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word\n",
      "DUCKSPEAK, meaning 'to quack like a duck'. Like various other words in\n",
      "the B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the\n",
      "opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but\n",
      "praise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators of the Party\n",
      "as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and\n",
      "consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the\n",
      "scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots,\n",
      "but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of\n",
      "undesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the\n",
      "words in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had any\n",
      "currency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific\n",
      "worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted\n",
      "to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the\n",
      "words occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to\n",
      "all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science\n",
      "as a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular\n",
      "branches. There was, indeed, no word for 'Science', any meaning that it\n",
      "could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression\n",
      "of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.\n",
      "It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a\n",
      "species of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say\n",
      "BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely\n",
      "conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by\n",
      "reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas\n",
      "inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form,\n",
      "and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and\n",
      "condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.\n",
      "One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by\n",
      "illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For\n",
      "example, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only\n",
      "in the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak\n",
      "sentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed\n",
      "a palpable untruth--i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or\n",
      "strength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this\n",
      "secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word EQUAL.\n",
      "In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication,\n",
      "the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might\n",
      "remember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for\n",
      "any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within\n",
      "a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have\n",
      "vanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no\n",
      "more know that EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning of 'politically\n",
      "equal', or that FREE had once meant 'intellectually free', than for\n",
      "instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the\n",
      "secondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would be many\n",
      "crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply\n",
      "because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be\n",
      "foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics\n",
      "of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced--its words growing\n",
      "fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of\n",
      "putting them to improper uses always diminishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with\n",
      "the past would have been severed. History had already been rewritten,\n",
      "but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there,\n",
      "imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one's knowledge of\n",
      "Oldspeak it was possible to read them. In the future such fragments, even\n",
      "if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable.\n",
      "It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless\n",
      "it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday\n",
      "action, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeak\n",
      "expression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written before\n",
      "approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary\n",
      "literature could only be subjected to ideological translation--that is,\n",
      "alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-known\n",
      "passage from the Declaration of Independence:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while\n",

      "A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being\n",

      "only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for\n",
      "supper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to\n",
      "these dumplings in a most direful manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you'll have the nightmare to a dead\n",
      "sartainty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the\n",
      "harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he\n",
      "don't--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The devil he does,\" says I.  \"Where is that harpooneer?  Is he\n",
      "here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll be here afore long,\" was the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark\n",
      "complexioned\" harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my mind that if it\n",
      "so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get\n",
      "into bed before I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\n",
      "what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\n",
      "evening as a looker on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the\n",
      "landlord cried, \"That's the Grampus's crew.  I seed her reported in\n",
      "the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship.\n",
      "Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the Feegees.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\n",
      "open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in\n",
      "their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\n",
      "comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\n",
      "icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had\n",
      "just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\n",
      "entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\n",
      "whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\n",
      "officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained\n",
      "of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like\n",
      "potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for\n",
      "all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,\n",
      "or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side\n",
      "of an ice-island.\n",
      "\n",
      "The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\n",
      "with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\n",
      "capering about most obstreperously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\n",
      "own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\n",
      "noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the\n",
      "sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\n",
      "but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),\n",
      "I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\n",
      "six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\n",
      "coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\n",
      "deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\n",
      "contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\n",
      "reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\n",
      "once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\n",
      "thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\n",
      "Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\n",
      "had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\n",
      "saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\n",
      "minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\n",
      "seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\n",
      "of \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\n",
      "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\n",
      "the entrance of the seamen.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\n",
      "to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\n",
      "indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\n",
      "sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\n",
      "no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\n",
      "be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\n",
      "own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in\n",
      "your own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\n",
      "of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\n",
      "over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\n",
      "to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\n",
      "me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\n",
      "coming?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't\n",
      "sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots\n",
      "and notches.  \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's\n",
      "plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\"\n",
      "So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\n",
      "first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\n",
      "the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\n",
      "till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\n",
      "The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\n",
      "heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\n",
      "not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\n",
      "pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\n",
      "throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\n",
      "about his business, and left me in a brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\n",
      "But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\n",
      "from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\n",
      "all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\n",
      "from the window, and both together formed a series of small\n",
      "whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\n",
      "to spend the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\n",
      "steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\n",
      "not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\n",
      "idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell\n",
      "but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\n",
      "harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\n",
      "down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I\n",
      "began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\n",
      "prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait\n",
      "awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at\n",
      "him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\n",
      "all--there's no telling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\n",
      "threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\n",
      "such late hours?\"  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\n",
      "mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  \"No,\" he\n",
      "answered, \"generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\n",
      "rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he\n",
      "went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him\n",
      "so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\n",
      "are telling me?\" getting into a towering rage.  \"Do you pretend to\n",
      "say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\n",
      "Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\n",
      "this town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't\n",
      "sell it here, the market's overstocked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With what?\" shouted I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd better\n",
      "stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\n",
      "rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a\n",
      "slanderin' his head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at\n",
      "this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's broke a'ready,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Broke,\" said I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\n",
      "snow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one\n",
      "another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a\n",
      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I\n",
      "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\n",
      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of\n",
      "connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the\n",
      "highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and\n",
      "what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe\n",
      "to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so\n",
      "good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\n",
      "take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've\n",
      "no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,\n",
      "landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would\n",
      "thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty\n",
      "long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,\n",
      "be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just\n",
      "arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New\n",
      "Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but\n",
      "one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's\n",
      "Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the\n",
      "streets when folks is goin' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,\n",
      "but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four\n",
      "heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\n",
      "showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling\n",
      "me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\n",
      "stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\n",
      "in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder.  \"But come, it's getting\n",
      "dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;\n",
      "Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's\n",
      "plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty\n",
      "big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\n",
      "little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\n",
      "about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\n",
      "near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come\n",
      "along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\n",
      "a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\n",
      "stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\n",
      "\"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come\n",
      "to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\n",
      "was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\n",
      "enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\n",
      "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\n",
      "shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\n",
      "striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\n",
      "there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\n",
      "corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's\n",
      "wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\n",
      "parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\n",
      "fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\n",
      "round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\n",
      "this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\n",
      "it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\n",
      "and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\n",
      "I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\n",
      "and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\n",
      "my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\n",
      "bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\n",
      "sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\n",
      "heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\n",
      "word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\n",
      "from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\n",
      "the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\n",
      "room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\n",
      "for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This\n",
      "accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\n",
      "sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\n",
      "and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's\n",
      "just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\n",
      "got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\n",
      "that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n",
      "plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n",
      "squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\n",
      "first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\n",
      "truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\n",
      "whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\n",
      "them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\n",
      "voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\n",
      "thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in\n",
      "any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\n",
      "completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\n",
      "might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\n",
      "heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\n",
      "However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\n",
      "there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\n",
      "all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\n",
      "harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\n",
      "pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\n",
      "on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\n",
      "then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\n",
      "it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\n",
      "hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\n",
      "hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\n",

      "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\n",
      "frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\n",
      "plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\n",
      "of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\n",
      "country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps\n",

      "that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\n",
      "in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\n",
      "and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\n",
      "that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\n",
      "be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\n",
      "the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\n",
      "a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\n",
      "appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\n",
      "places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\n",
      "biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\n",
      "shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\n",
      "snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\n",
      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\n",
      "in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\n",
      "little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\n",
      "little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\n",
      "never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\n",
      "still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\n",
      "praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\n",
      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\n",
      "unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\n",
      "which I had so long been bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\n",
      "one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\n",
      "it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\n",
      "at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\n",
      "help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\n",
      "feeling me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\n",
      "his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\n",
      "comprehended my meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\n",

      "me in the dark.\n",
      "\n",

      "the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\n",
      "fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\n",
      "room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\n",
      "wouldn't harm a hair of your head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\n",
      "that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads\n",

      "sitting up in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\n",
      "civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\n",
      "moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n",
      "looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,\n",
      "thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has\n",
      "just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\n",
      "Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\n",
      "or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I\n",
      "will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed\n",
      "with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\n",

      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\n",
      "thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\n",
      "almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\n",
      "patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\n",
      "and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\n",
      "labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\n",
      "shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\n",
      "in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\n",
      "times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\n",
      "strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\n",
      "the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\n",
      "quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\n",
      "sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\n",
      "hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\n",
      "a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\n",
      "me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\n",
      "settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\n",
      "or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\n",
      "seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\n",
      "supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon\n",
      "of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\n",
      "felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\n",
      "sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\n",
      "the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\n",
      "the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\n",
      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\n",
      "worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\n",
      "good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\n",
      "me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\n",
      "best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\n",
      "my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\n",
      "deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\n",
      "dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\n",
      "in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\n",
      "For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\n",
      "awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\n",
      "if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n",
      "broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\n",
      "me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\n",
      "for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\n",
      "puzzle myself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,\n",
      "to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\n",
      "arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events\n",
      "soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\n",
      "alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\n",
      "arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\n",
      "hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\n",
      "I now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\n",
      "snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\n",
      "horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\n",
      "counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as\n",
      "if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\n",
      "abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\n",
      "tomahawk!  \"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"  At\n",
      "length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\n",
      "expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\n",
      "in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\n",
      "and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\n",
      "Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\n",
      "pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\n",
      "altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\n",
      "over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\n",
      "misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a\n",
      "creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the\n",
      "character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to\n",
      "the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\n",
      "sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\n",
      "first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\n",
      "apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,\n",
      "this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages\n",
      "have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\n",
      "how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to\n",
      "Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\n",
      "consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\n",
      "from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\n",
      "curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man\n",
      "like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\n",
      "one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his\n",
      "boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\n",
      "next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\n",
      "the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\n",
      "inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\n",
      "propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\n",
      "when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\n",
      "in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was\n",
      "just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\n",
      "possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\n",
      "undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\n",
      "probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\n",
      "if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\n",
      "getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\n",
      "hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\n",
      "creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\n",
      "to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\n",
      "to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off\n",
      "of a bitter cold morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n",
      "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\n",
      "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\n",
      "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots\n",
      "on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\n",
      "somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\n",
      "possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that\n",
      "time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but\n",
      "Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his\n",
      "ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his\n",
      "waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand\n",
      "centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.\n",
      "I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\n",
      "takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden\n",
      "stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\n",
      "striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\n",
      "scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
      "this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I\n",
      "wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine\n",
      "steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the\n",
      "long straight edges are always kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out\n",
      "of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and\n",

      "sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\n",
      "dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,\n",
      "Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort\n",
      "of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for\n",
      "among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\n",
      "gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\n",
      "even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his\n",
      "history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\n",
      "utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\n",
      "he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\n",
      "and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\n",
      "down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\n",
      "almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\n",
      "absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\n",
      "removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\n",
      "arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\n",
      "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\n",
      "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\n",
      "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\n",
      "side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\n",
      "The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\n",
      "pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\n",
      "nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\n",
      "contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\n",
      "means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\n",
      "ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\n",
      "man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\n",
      "sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\n",
      "the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\n",
      "with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\n",
      "of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first\n",
      "glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\n",
      "for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\n",
      "For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\n",
      "slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\n",
      "the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\n",
      "him impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n",
      "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\n",
      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\n",
      "unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\n",
      "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\n",
      "worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and\n",
      "wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\n",
      "a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\n",
      "perennial well of water within the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\n",
      "back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\n",
      "beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\n",
      "snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\n",
      "clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\n",
      "forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\n",
      "radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver\n",
      "plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  \"Ah,\n",
      "noble ship,\" the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble\n",

      "\n",
      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in\n",
      "the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\n",
      "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's\n",
      "fiddle-headed beak.\n",

      "What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this\n",

      "leads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is\n",

      "thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for\n",

      "paves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,\n",
      "prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to\n",

      "there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something\n",
      "about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked\n",
      "within.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into\n",
      "his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on\n",

      "and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\n",
      "towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\n",

      "For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\n",

      "brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\n",
      "gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\n",
      "Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see\n",
      "just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\n",
      "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\n",
      "other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\n",

      "insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among\n",
      "the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;\n",
      "instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\n",
      "the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\n",
      "befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a\n",
      "vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light\n",
      "upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in\n",
      "that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present\n",
      "irrespective of Queequeg.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed\n",
      "great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising\n",
      "forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a\n",
      "rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the\n",

      "little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best\n",
      "fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my\n",
      "remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\n",
      "acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a\n",
      "determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\n",
      "settle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving\n",
      "Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that\n",

      "find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never\n",
      "could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg,\n",
      "then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\n",
      "sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.\n",
      "After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt\n",
      "that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The\n",
      "Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not know\n",
      "the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt\n",
      "remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts\n",
      "Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about\n",
      "the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,\n",
      "going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then\n",
      "decided that this was the very ship for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\n",
      "know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\n",
      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\n",
      "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the\n",
      "old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\n",
      "claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\n",
      "typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was\n",
      "darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and\n",
      "Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut\n",
      "somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\n",
      "overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\n",
      "the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and\n",
      "wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\n",
      "Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,\n",
      "were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\n",
      "business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old\n",
      "Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another\n",
      "vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\n",
      "owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\n",
      "chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\n",
      "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\n",
      "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or\n",
      "bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\n",
      "his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of\n",
      "trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\n",
      "chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open\n",
      "bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\n",
      "teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\n",
      "hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks\n",
      "of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.\n",
      "Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a\n",
      "tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the\n",
      "long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who\n",
      "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he\n",
      "holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but\n",
      "somehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\n",
      "authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\n",
      "at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort\n",
      "of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It\n",
      "seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical\n",
      "shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\n",
      "limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\n",
      "of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\n",
      "circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\n",
      "other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose\n",
      "hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\n",
      "Pottowottamie Sachem's head.  A triangular opening faced towards the\n",
      "bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view\n",
      "forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\n",
      "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\n",
      "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden\n",
      "of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\n",
      "all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of\n",
      "a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\n",
      "constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance\n",
      "of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old\n",
      "seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker\n",
      "style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the\n",
      "minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen\n",
      "from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\n",
      "windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become\n",
      "pursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\n",

      "For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\n",
      "knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.\n",

      "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\n",
      "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\n",
      "pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but\n",
      "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that\n",
      "I could see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\n",
      "see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon\n",
      "though, and there's a squall coming up, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to\n",

      "where you stand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and\n",
      "the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all\n",
      "this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed\n",
      "his willingness to ship me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\n",
      "along with ye.\"  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\n",
      "surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along\n",
      "with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the\n",
      "other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by\n",
      "a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery\n",
      "wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of\n",
      "plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest\n",
      "their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in\n",
      "approved state stocks bringing in good interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\n",
      "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and\n",
      "to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\n",
      "the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously\n",
      "modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of\n",
      "these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and\n",
      "whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\n",
      "vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\n",
      "Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in\n",
      "childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of\n",
      "the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\n",
      "adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\n",
      "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\n",
      "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And\n",
      "when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\n",
      "with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\n",
      "stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\n",
      "waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been\n",
      "led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\n",
      "nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\n",
      "voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\n",
      "help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\n",
      "language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty\n",
      "pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all\n",
      "detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\n",
      "circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness\n",
      "at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made\n",
      "so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,\n",
      "all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do\n",
      "with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if\n",
      "indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the\n",
      "Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\n",
      "whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what\n",
      "are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious\n",
      "things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been\n",
      "originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\n",
      "Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\n",
      "unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not\n",
      "moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\n",
      "altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,\n",
      "was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\n",
      "Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\n",
      "against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\n",
      "Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\n",
      "had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\n",
      "leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\n",
      "the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\n",
      "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\n",
      "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a\n",
      "man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\n",
      "This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short\n",
      "clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\n",
      "waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\n",
      "and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\n",
      "his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\n",
      "goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\n",
      "receiving of his well-earned income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\n",
      "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\n",
      "task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\n",
      "crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\n",
      "hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially\n",
      "for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the\n",
      "least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but\n",
      "somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work\n",
      "out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured\n",
      "eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\n",
      "you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\n",
      "work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and\n",
      "idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\n",
      "embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\n",
      "carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\n",
      "economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the\n",
      "decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\n",
      "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\n",
      "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\n",
      "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\n",
      "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have\n",
      "been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\n",
      "certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\n",
      "and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n",

      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\n",
      "Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I\n",
      "said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a\n",
      "chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink\n",
      "before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think\n",
      "it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\n",
      "willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the\n",
      "whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\n",
      "captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that\n",
      "these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining\n",
      "to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware\n",
      "that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\n",
      "large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a\n",
      "ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\n",
      "had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the\n",
      "275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that\n",
      "might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they\n",
      "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had\n",
      "a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear\n",
      "out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which\n",
      "I would not have to pay one stiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\n",
      "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of\n",
      "those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite\n",
      "content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am\n",
      "putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I\n",
      "thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not\n",
      "have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was\n",
      "of a broad-shouldered make.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n",
      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\n",
      "heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\n",
      "Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\n",
      "therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,\n",
      "left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.\n",
      "And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\n",
      "deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on\n",
      "board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\n",
      "Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying\n",
      "to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small\n",
      "surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these\n",
      "proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself\n",
      "out of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\n",
      "where moth--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\n",
      "shall we give this young man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust\n",
      "do corrupt, but LAY--'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\n",
      "one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\n",
      "corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\n",
      "from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\n",
      "landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\n",
      "come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less\n",
      "than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought\n",
      "at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\n",
      "lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure\n",
      "is, there will your heart be also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\n",
      "ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider\n",
      "the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and\n",
      "orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the\n",
      "labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those\n",
      "widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,\n",
      "Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\n",
      "cabin.  \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\n",
      "these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\n",
      "would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\n",
      "round Cape Horn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\n",
      "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art\n",
      "still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\n",
      "conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee\n",
      "foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,\n",

      "that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again\n",
      "to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a\n",
      "live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye\n",

      "\n",
      "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\n",

      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\n",
      "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\n",
      "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n",
      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\n",
      "who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\n",
      "awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again\n",
      "on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\n",
      "intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg\n",
      "and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,\n",
      "there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\n",
      "though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  \"Whew!\"\n",
      "he whistled at last--\"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.\n",
      "Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,\n",
      "will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank\n",
      "ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye\n",
      "say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth\n",
      "lay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
      "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg.  \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\n",
      "in which he had again been burying himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg.  \"Has he ever\n",
      "whaled it any?\" turning to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, bring him along then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that\n",
      "I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the\n",
      "identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\n",
      "the Cape.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\n",
      "Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\n",
      "indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,\n",
      "and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\n",
      "visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\n",
      "so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\n",
      "that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\n",
      "that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\n",
      "but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it\n",
      "is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\n",
      "yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\n",
      "inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;\n",
      "thou art shipped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know\n",
      "exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\n",
      "house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't\n",
      "sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't\n",
      "always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him\n",
      "well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\n",
      "may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;\n",
      "Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to\n",
      "deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\n",
      "stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\n",
      "that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he\n",
      "ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\n",
      "was a crowned king!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\n",
      "they not lick his blood?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\n",
      "in his eye that almost startled me.  \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\n",
      "board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name\n",
      "himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\n",
      "mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old\n",
      "squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\n",
      "prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\n",
      "same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;\n",
      "I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good\n",
      "man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good\n",
      "man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,\n",
      "aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the\n",
      "passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was\n",
      "the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\n",
      "about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost\n",
      "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of\n",
      "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\n",
      "off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,\n",
      "it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\n",
      "one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\n",
      "happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not\n",
      "three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that\n",
      "sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any\n",

      "As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\n",
      "incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\n",
      "wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the\n",
      "time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know\n",
      "what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a\n",
      "strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all\n",

      "him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but\n",
      "his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could\n",
      "not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the\n",
      "mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that\n",
      "uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me\n",
      "really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room\n",
      "with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable\n",
      "Ramadan!\n",
      "\n",
      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break\n",
      "of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as\n",
      "if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first\n",
      "glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating\n",
      "joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;\n",
      "pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was\n",

      "the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to\n",
      "the various religions of the present time, during which time I\n",
      "labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\n",
      "prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark\n",
      "nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in\n",
      "short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,\n",
      "too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and\n",
      "sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now\n",
      "so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,\n",
      "argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;\n",
      "and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.\n",
      "This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such\n",
      "melancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,\n",
      "said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an\n",
      "undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the\n",
      "hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\n",
      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\n",
      "in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a\n",
      "great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great\n",
      "battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two\n",
      "o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew\n",
      "the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor\n",
      "who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\n",
      "custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\n",
      "the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\n",
      "they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like\n",
      "a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\n",
      "their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all\n",
      "his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas\n",
      "turkeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow\n",
      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\n",
      "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\n",
      "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\n",
      "religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending\n",
      "concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that\n",

      "questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand\n",
      "that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all\n",
      "sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the\n",
      "custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to\n",
      "furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up\n",
      "eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and\n",
      "alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much\n",
      "better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into\n",
      "walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\n",

      "perhaps in some damp marshy place.\n",
      "\n",

      "The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and\n",
      "a Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man, and though born on\n",
      "an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh\n",
      "being hard as twice-baked biscuit.  Transported to the Indies, his\n",
      "live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.  He must have been born\n",
      "in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast\n",
      "days for which his state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers\n",
      "had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical\n",
      "superfluousness.  But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more\n",
      "the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the\n",
      "indication of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of\n",
      "the man.  He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.  His\n",
      "pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,\n",
      "and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified\n",
      "Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to\n",
      "come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid\n",
      "sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted\n",
      "to do well in all climates.  Looking into his eyes, you seemed to\n",
      "see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\n",
      "had calmly confronted through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose\n",
      "life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a\n",
      "tame chapter of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and\n",
      "fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times\n",
      "affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the\n",
      "rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep\n",
      "natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did\n",
      "therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of\n",
      "superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,\n",
      "somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and\n",
      "inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the\n",
      "welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories\n",
      "of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from\n",
      "the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to\n",
      "those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain\n",
      "the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more\n",
      "perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  \"I will have no man in my\n",
      "boat,\" said Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\"  By this, he\n",
      "seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage\n",
      "was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered\n",
      "peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous\n",
      "comrade than a coward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye,\" said Stubb, the second mate, \"Starbuck, there, is as\n",
      "careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery.\"  But we shall\n",

      "\n",
      "Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\n",
      "sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\n",
      "all mortally practical occasions.  Besides, he thought, perhaps, that\n",
      "in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple\n",
      "outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be\n",
      "foolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales\n",
      "after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\n",
      "persisted in fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this\n",
      "critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by\n",
      "them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck\n",
      "well knew.  What doom was his own father's?  Where, in the bottomless\n",
      "deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\n",
      "\n",
      "With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\n",
      "superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck\n",
      "which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been\n",
      "extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so\n",
      "organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he\n",
      "had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently\n",
      "engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\n",
      "would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.\n",
      "And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,\n",
      "visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in\n",
      "the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary\n",
      "irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more\n",
      "terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you\n",
      "from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.\n",

      "But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\n",
      "abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\n",
      "to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to\n",

      "throw their costliest robes.  That immaculate manliness we feel\n",
      "within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all\n",

      "undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety itself, at\n",

      "permitting stars.  But this august dignity I treat of, is not the\n",

      "short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.\n",
      "You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk\n",
      "without his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes\n",
      "there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;\n",
      "and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,\n",
      "lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading\n",
      "them again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed, instead\n",

      "I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of\n",

      "encountered.  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for\n",
      "the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead\n",
      "to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from\n",
      "encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was\n",
      "but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring\n",
      "only a little circumvention and some small application of time and\n",
      "trouble in order to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious\n",
      "fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of\n",
      "whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years'\n",
      "voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length\n",
      "of time.  As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and\n",
      "cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one\n",
      "of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.  They called\n",

      "assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a\n",
      "close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in\n",

      "remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\n",
      "neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\n",
      "harpooneers.  In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\n",
      "Gay-Headers.  Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek\n",
      "bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their\n",
      "largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this\n",
      "sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of\n",
      "those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England\n",
      "moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.\n",
      "But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the\n",
      "woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the\n",
      "sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible\n",
      "arrow of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky\n",
      "limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of\n",
      "the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son\n",

      "\n",
      "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\n",
      "negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.\n",
      "Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the\n",
      "sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the\n",
      "top-sail halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily\n",
      "shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native\n",
      "coast.  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa,\n",
      "Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and\n",
      "having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the\n",
      "ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they\n",
      "shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a\n",
      "giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in\n",
      "his socks.  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and\n",
      "a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce\n",
      "of a fortress.  Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus\n",
      "Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man\n",
      "beside him.  As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said,\n",
      "that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\n",
      "before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\n",
      "born, though pretty nearly all the officers are.  Herein it is the\n",

      "say, because in all these cases the native American liberally\n",
      "provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying\n",

      "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\n",

      "when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without\n",
      "consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged\n",
      "robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,\n",
      "and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus.\n",
      "Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right\n",
      "down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it\n",
      "disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly\n",
      "whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the\n",
      "straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning\n",
      "tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels\n",
      "and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the\n",
      "soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether\n",
      "that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some\n",
      "desperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,\n",
      "throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,\n",
      "especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head\n",
      "Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was\n",
      "full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it\n",
      "came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an\n",
      "elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\n",

      "to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had\n",

      "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side\n",
      "of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\n",
      "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\n",
      "plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\n",
      "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\n",
      "beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of\n",
      "firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\n",
      "fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he\n",
      "spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\n",
      "minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if\n",
      "not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And\n",
      "not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a\n",
      "crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing\n",
      "dignity of some mighty woe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his\n",

      "either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he\n",
      "had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;\n",
      "indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less\n",
      "a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the\n",
      "dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,\n",
      "by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the\n",
      "air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at\n",
      "last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But\n",
      "the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;\n",

      "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n",

      "with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will\n",
      "try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters\n",
      "it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his\n",
      "System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\n",
      "the whales from the fish.\"  But of my own knowledge, I know that down\n",
      "to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\n",
      "Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\n",
      "the same seas with the Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales\n",
      "from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm\n",
      "bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\n",
      "ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex\n",
      "lege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all this to my friends\n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine\n",
      "in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons\n",
      "set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted\n",
      "they were humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has\n",
      "given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm\n",
      "blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,\n",
      "a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have\n",
      "him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
      "meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not\n",
      "a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the\n",
      "definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost\n",
      "any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have\n",
      "not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among\n",
      "spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\n",
      "assumes a horizontal position.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\n",
      "alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\n",
      "must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come\n",
      "the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins\n",
      "and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\n",
      "included by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish\n",
      "are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of\n",
      "rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,\n",

      "Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the\n",
      "whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing\n",
      "the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the length he\n",
      "attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale,\n",
      "but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to\n",
      "olive.  His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the\n",
      "intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand\n",
      "distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is\n",
      "often a conspicuous object.  This fin is some three or four feet\n",
      "long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an\n",
      "angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the\n",
      "slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin\n",
      "will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.  When\n",
      "the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical\n",
      "ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon\n",
      "the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle\n",
      "surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy\n",
      "hour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\n",
      "back.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.  He seems a whale-hater, as\n",
      "some men are man-haters.  Very shy; always going solitary;\n",
      "unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen\n",
      "waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall\n",
      "misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous\n",
      "power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from\n",
      "man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his\n",
      "race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.  From having the\n",
      "baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the\n",
      "right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,\n",
      "that is, whales with baleen.  Of these so called Whalebone whales,\n",
      "there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are\n",
      "little known.  Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed\n",

      "convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it\n",
      "is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,\n",
      "founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;\n",
      "notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously\n",
      "seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\n",
      "Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the\n",
      "whale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?  The baleen, hump,\n",
      "back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are\n",
      "indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any\n",
      "regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and\n",
      "more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\n",
      "whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.  Then, this\n",
      "same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has\n",
      "baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.  And it is just the\n",
      "same with the other parts above mentioned.  In various sorts of\n",
      "whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any\n",
      "one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy\n",
      "all general methodization formed upon such a basis.  On this rock\n",
      "every one of the whale-naturalists has split.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\n",

      "right classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\n",
      "Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?  Yet we have\n",
      "seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\n",

      "\n",
      "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\n",
      "place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,\n",
      "arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a\n",
      "class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
      "officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means\n",
      "Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\n",
      "Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to\n",
      "the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\n",
      "whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or\n",
      "Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,\n",
      "under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is\n",
      "still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present\n",
      "he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the\n",
      "captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good\n",
      "conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\n",
      "depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\n",
      "important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\n",
      "watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also\n",
      "his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he\n",
      "should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in\n",
      "some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,\n",
      "by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\n",
      "this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships\n",
      "and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the\n",
      "captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers\n",
      "are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take\n",

      "the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\n",
      "low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\n",

      "But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\n",
      "abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\n",

      "\n",
      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she\n",
      "may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her\n",
      "proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'\n",
      "voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an\n",
      "empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;\n",
      "and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,\n",
      "does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\n",
      "very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\n",
      "here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the\n",
      "old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to\n",
      "them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must\n",
      "doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest\n",
      "mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\n",
      "put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have\n",
      "gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we\n",
      "cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And\n",
      "that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an\n",
      "assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that\n",
      "the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory\n",
      "singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\n",
      "sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\n",
      "their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and\n",
      "sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing\n",
      "out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,\n",
      "the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone\n",
      "pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life\n",
      "on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in\n",
      "him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by\n",
      "fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything\n",
      "out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern\n",
      "standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\n",
      "and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\n",
      "are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\n",
      "discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top\n",
      "of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred\n",
      "and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\n",
      "whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great\n",
      "Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\n",
      "Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that\n",
      "point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral\n",
      "Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\n",
      "Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\n",
      "token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\n",
      "smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\n",
      "Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked\n",
      "to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they\n",

      "through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what\n",

      "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells\n",
      "us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\n",
      "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\n",
      "erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\n",
      "ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in\n",
      "a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay\n",
      "whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to\n",
      "the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now\n",
      "become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\n",
      "whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from\n",

      "helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene\n",
      "weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,\n",
      "to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a\n",
      "hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\n",
      "the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your\n",
      "legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships\n",
      "once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\n",

      "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling\n",
      "accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\n",
      "excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one\n",
      "morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\n",
      "cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains usually walk at\n",
      "that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few\n",
      "turns in the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his\n",
      "old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all\n",
      "over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his\n",
      "walk.  Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;\n",
      "there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints\n",
      "of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as\n",
      "his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.  And, so full of\n",
      "his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at\n",
      "the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that\n",
      "thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so\n",
      "completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward\n",
      "mould of every outer movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"D'ye mark him, Flask?\" whispered Stubb; \"the chick that's in him\n",

      "\n",
      "The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing\n",
      "the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the\n",
      "bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\n",
      "with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send\n",
      "everybody aft.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir!\" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\n",
      "ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send everybody aft,\" repeated Ahab.  \"Mast-heads, there! come down!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and\n",
      "not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not\n",
      "unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after\n",
      "rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among\n",
      "the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were\n",
      "nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and\n",
      "half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering\n",
      "whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,\n",
      "that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing\n",
      "a pedestrian feat.  But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing,\n",
      "he cried:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "clubbed voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\n",
      "hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so\n",

      "\"And what do ye next, men?\"\n",

      "More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\n",
      "countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began\n",
      "to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that\n",
      "they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in\n",
      "his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\n",
      "almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a\n",
      "white whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\"--holding\n",
      "up a broad bright coin to the sun--\"it is a sixteen dollar piece,\n",
      "men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\n",
      "slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\n",
      "to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\n",
      "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\n",
      "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\n",
      "his vitality in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\n",
      "main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold\n",
      "with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever\n",
      "of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a\n",
      "crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with\n",
      "three holes punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of\n",
      "ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my\n",
      "boys!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\n",
      "hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a white whale, I say,\" resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\n",
      "topmaul: \"a white whale.  Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\n",
      "white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even\n",
      "more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention\n",
      "of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\n",
      "separately touched by some specific recollection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Ahab,\" said Tashtego, \"that white whale must be the same\n",

      "the Gay-Header deliberately.\n",

      "and round as though uncorking a bottle--\"like him--him--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Corkscrew!\" cried Ahab, \"aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted\n",

      "whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after\n",
      "the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like\n",

      "far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last\n",
      "seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.\n",
      "\"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Who told thee that?\" cried Ahab; then pausing, \"Aye, Starbuck; aye,\n",
      "my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick\n",
      "that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, aye,\" he\n",
      "shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a\n",
      "heart-stricken moose; \"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale\n",
      "that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\"\n",
      "Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted\n",
      "out: \"Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the\n",
      "Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames\n",
      "before I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to\n",
      "chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of\n",
      "earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.  What say ye,\n",
      "men, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye do look brave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\n",

      "Moby Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless ye,\" he seemed to half sob and half shout.  \"God bless ye,\n",
      "men.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.  But what's this\n",
      "long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,\n",

      "sinewing it.  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be\n",
      "the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak\n",

      "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\n",

      "naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only\n",
      "to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to\n",
      "be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human\n",
      "blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or\n",

      "days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to\n",
      "induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this\n",
      "new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other\n",
      "leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance\n",
      "at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.\n",
      "That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\n",
      "eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may\n",
      "be consulted.\n",

      "Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\n",
      "were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number\n",
      "who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\n",
      "specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\n",
      "accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle\n",
      "if offered.\n",

      "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\n",
      "linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously\n",

      "that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one\n",
      "and the same instant of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\n",

      "divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of\n",
      "the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,\n",
      "unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated\n",
      "the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\n",
      "especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a\n",
      "great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the\n",
      "most widely distant points.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,\n",
      "and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by\n",
      "Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the\n",
      "Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted\n",
      "in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of\n",
      "these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\n",
      "between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\n",
      "Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\n",
      "Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to\n",
      "the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living\n",
      "men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\n",
      "mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in\n",
      "which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still\n",
      "more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose\n",
      "waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an\n",
      "underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\n",
      "equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\n",
      "knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\n",
      "escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some\n",
      "whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring\n",
      "Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but\n",
      "ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in\n",
      "his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should\n",
      "ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a\n",

      "But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough\n",

      "his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm\n",
      "whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white\n",
      "wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were\n",

      "uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to\n",
      "those who knew him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\n",
      "the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\n",
      "distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally\n",
      "justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through\n",
      "a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all\n",
      "spangled with golden gleamings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet\n",

      "terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\n",
      "specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his\n",
      "assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\n",
      "dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his\n",
      "exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\n",
      "several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down\n",
      "upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back\n",
      "in consternation to their ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though\n",
      "similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means\n",
      "unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White\n",
      "Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or\n",
      "death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been\n",
      "inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds\n",
      "of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of\n",
      "chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out\n",

      "exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n",
      "\n",
      "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in\n",

      "seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the\n",
      "various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but\n",
      "steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were\n",
      "blank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside\n",

      "various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been\n",
      "captured or seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over\n",
      "his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for\n",
      "ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled\n",

      "also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his\n",
      "forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\n",

      "were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,\n",
      "and others were substituted.  For with the charts of all four oceans\n",
      "before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a\n",

      "it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\n",
      "creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.  But not so did it\n",

      "also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting\n",

      "So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\n",

      "that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\n",
      "were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\n",

      "\n",

      "an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n",
      "Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it\n",
      "appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n",
      "portions of it are presented in the circular.  \"This chart divides\n",
      "the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\n",
      "of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\n",
      "twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\n",
      "of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days\n",
      "that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two\n",

      "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\n",

      "secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are\n",
      "called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\n",
      "undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\n",
      "chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these\n",
      "cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\n",
      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\n",
      "VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\n",
      "some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\n",
      "expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\n",
      "whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\n",
      "zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\n",
      "along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked\n",
      "for.\n",
      "\n",
      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\n",
      "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in\n",
      "crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,\n",
      "by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to\n",
      "be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\n",
      "delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,\n",
      "perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular\n",
      "seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude\n",
      "that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude\n",
      "this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those\n",
      "that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\n",
      "and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\n",
      "true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\n",
      "applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\n",
      "whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\n",
      "example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\n",
      "or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\n",
      "were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\n",
      "corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,\n",
      "too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed\n",
      "himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\n",
      "ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And\n",
      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\n",
      "spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\n",
      "antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\n",
      "place were attained, when all possibilities would become\n",
      "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\n",
      "next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were\n",
      "conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For\n",
      "there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\n",
      "periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\n",
      "sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one\n",
      "sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly\n",
      "encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\n",
      "storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\n",
      "monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But\n",
      "in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with\n",
      "which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he\n",
      "would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning\n",
      "fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;\n",
      "nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\n",
      "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\n",
      "the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her\n",
      "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\n",
      "then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\n",
      "Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the\n",
      "next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing\n",
      "had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this\n",
      "very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and\n",
      "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\n",
      "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous\n",
      "hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far\n",
      "remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his\n",
      "wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China\n",
      "Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,\n",
      "Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter\n",
      "and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\n",

      "individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\n",
      "in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the\n",

      "whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till\n",
      "the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\n",
      "when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\n",
      "his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\n",
      "which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\n",
      "beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself\n",

      "hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,\n",
      "was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror\n",
      "again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;\n",
      "and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing\n",
      "mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or\n",
      "agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\n",
      "of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\n",
      "integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\n",

      "which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and\n",
      "unfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of\n",
      "bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the\n",
      "time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of\n",

      "and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.\n",
      "After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in\n",

      "day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather\n",
      "was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged\n",
      "to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;\n",
      "it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest\n",
      "sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger\n",
      "than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\n",
      "not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,\n",
      "which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\n",
      "impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed\n",
      "in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up\n",
      "its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The\n",
      "masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\n",
      "all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\n",
      "upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with\n",
      "the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately\n",
      "to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any\n",
      "damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped\n",
      "entirely uninjured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\n",
      "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\n",
      "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\n",
      "Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.\n",
      "I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\n",
      "Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by\n",
      "no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,\n",

      "four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\n",
      "leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\n",
      "which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\n",
      "where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for\n",
      "death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we\n",
      "took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\n",
      "amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\n",
      "no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in\n",
      "their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their\n",
      "hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown\n",
      "out of his cabin!\"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\n",
      "earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that\n",
      "a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\n",
      "mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in\n",
      "the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after\n",

      "more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\n",
      "assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\n",
      "and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The\n",
      "English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\n",
      "his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\n",
      "lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\n",
      "transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\n",
      "great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.\n",

      "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\n",
      "magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor\n",
      "and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his\n",
      "own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best\n",
      "authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and\n",
      "unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not\n",
      "at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\n",
      "of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\n",
      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\n",
      "than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot\n",
      "easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what\n",
      "precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he\n",
      "destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a\n",
      "whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will\n",
      "tell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had\n",
      "been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters\n",
      "connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\n",
      "and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a\n",
      "place for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations\n",
      "have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been\n",
      "isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the\n",
      "Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\n",
      "coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a\n",
      "sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\n",
      "Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out\n",
      "of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\n",
      "substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\n",
      "But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\n",
      "whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\n",
      "large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\n",
      "found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements\n",
      "together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\n",
      "according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for\n",
      "half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\n",

      "altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or\n",
      "at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives\n",

      "perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his\n",
      "vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended\n",
      "itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters\n",
      "he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each\n",

      "\n",
      "To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used\n",

      "It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was\n",

      "into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,\n",
      "unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were\n",
      "brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of\n",
      "Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested\n",
      "than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for\n",
      "the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange\n",
      "imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full\n",

      "playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\n",
      "knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give\n",

      "sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near\n",

      "Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.  Swimming\n",
      "round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the\n",

      "the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our\n",

      "driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;\n",
      "no sign of the ship could be seen.  The rising sea forbade all\n",
      "attempts to bale out the boat.  The oars were useless as propellers,\n",

      "Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or\n",

      "to his ear.  We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards\n",
      "hitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the\n",
      "thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we\n",

      "his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed\n",
      "Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\n",
      "state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\n",
      "the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\n",
      "planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\n",
      "consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\n",

      "of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\n",

      "their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\n",
      "case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\n",
      "may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\n",

      "spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\n",
      "unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\n",
      "ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\n",

      "sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And\n",
      "then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\n",
      "lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\n",
      "pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied\n",
      "with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\n",

      "commanding him to do his bidding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\n",

      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\n",
      "was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round\n",

      "him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\n",
      "Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to\n",
      "yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\n",
      "where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an\n",
      "inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable\n",
      "maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;\n",
      "stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,\n",
      "Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing\n",

      "he (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been\n",

      "of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of\n",

      "as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt\n",
      "proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with\n",

      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to\n",
      "the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is\n",
      "moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon\n",
      "there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to\n",
      "those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the\n",
      "present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is\n",
      "time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\n",
      "of the whale all wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\n",
      "will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\n",
      "sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\n",
      "when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\n",
      "and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\n",
      "scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.\n",
      "George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\n",
      "prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in\n",
      "many scientific presentations of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\n",
      "to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\n",
      "Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost\n",
      "endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and\n",
      "pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages\n",
      "before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in\n",
      "some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\n",
      "shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate\n",
      "department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the\n",
      "form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though\n",
      "this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the\n",
      "tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It\n",

      "\n",
      "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\n",

      "Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as\n",
      "depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.\n",
      "What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding\n",
      "like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped\n",
      "and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and\n",
      "new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\n",
      "imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though\n",
      "universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\n",
      "book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\n",
      "when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\n",
      "Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\n",

      "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\n",

      "delineations, by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of\n",
      "voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book\n",
      "of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in\n",
      "the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\"\n",
      "In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\n",
      "represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over\n",
      "their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made\n",
      "of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\n",
      "Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round\n",
      "Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\n",
      "Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.\"  In this book is an outline purporting\n",
      "to be a \"Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale\n",
      "from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on\n",
      "deck.\"  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for\n",
      "the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let\n",
      "me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\n",
      "accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye\n",

      "\n",
      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\n",
      "the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness\n",
      "of mistake.  Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith's Animated Nature.\"\n",
      "In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an\n",
      "alleged \"whale\" and a \"narwhale.\"  I do not wish to seem inelegant,\n",
      "but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as\n",
      "for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in\n",
      "this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine\n",
      "upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\n",
      "naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\n",
      "several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All\n",
      "these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or\n",
      "Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a\n",
      "long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have\n",

      "But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\n",
      "reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\n",

      "he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing\n",

      "Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of course, he never had\n",
      "the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\n",
      "derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his\n",
      "scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his\n",
      "authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort\n",
      "of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and\n",

      "\n",
      "As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the\n",

      "of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\n",
      "paint.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\n",
      "surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings\n",
      "have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as\n",
      "correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would\n",
      "correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride\n",
      "of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their\n",
      "full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated\n",
      "himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and\n",
      "significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and\n",
      "afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched\n",
      "line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally\n",
      "impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to\n",
      "preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of\n",
      "the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking\n",
      "whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of\n",
      "one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is\n",
      "then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that\n",
      "his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\n",
      "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at\n",
      "all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\n",
      "that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.\n",
      "Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the\n",
      "library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a\n",
      "burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other\n",
      "leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be\n",
      "inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the\n",
      "great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same\n",
      "relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does\n",
      "to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity\n",
      "is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will\n",
      "be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the\n",
      "side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\n",
      "human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular\n",
      "bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all\n",
      "these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human\n",
      "fingers in an artificial covering.  \"However recklessly the whale may\n",
      "sometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be\n",
      "truly said to handle us without mittens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must\n",

      "world which must remain unpainted to the last.  True, one portrait\n",
      "may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with\n",
      "any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly\n",
      "way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And\n",
      "the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his\n",
      "living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you\n",
      "run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.\n",

      "and taken from paintings by one Garnery.  Respectively, they\n",
      "represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale.  In the first\n",
      "engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,\n",
      "just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and\n",
      "bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the\n",
      "stoven planks.  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is\n",
      "drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that\n",
      "prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an\n",
      "oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,\n",
      "and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the\n",
      "whole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub\n",
      "floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\n",
      "obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered\n",
      "about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the\n",
      "black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.\n",
      "Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this\n",
      "whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw\n",
      "so good a one.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\n",
      "the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\n",
      "black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\n",
      "Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\n",
      "that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\n",
      "must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls\n",
      "are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\n",
      "maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\n",
      "back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing\n",
      "through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake,\n",
      "and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught\n",
      "nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.  Thus, the foreground is\n",
      "all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is\n",
      "the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of\n",

      "tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes\n",
      "a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch\n",
      "in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice,\n",
      "which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very\n",
      "much of a concentrated one.  When the painted canvas cover is clapped\n",
      "on the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off\n",
      "with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\n",
      "eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\n",
      "tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\n",
      "This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts.\n",
      "First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional\n",
      "line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound\n",
      "so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally\n",
      "attached to the harpoon.  In these instances, the whale of course is\n",
      "shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the\n",
      "other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its\n",
      "consort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common\n",
      "safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached\n",
      "to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end\n",
      "almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not\n",
      "stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down\n",
      "after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no\n",
      "town-crier would ever find her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\n",
      "taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\n",
      "again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting\n",
      "crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs\n",
      "against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as\n",
      "they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks\n",
      "or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden\n",
      "pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping\n",
      "out.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and\n",
      "is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms\n",
      "(called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues\n",
      "its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then\n",
      "attached to the short-warp--the rope which is immediately connected\n",
      "with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes\n",
      "through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\n",
      "twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.  All the\n",
      "oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the\n",
      "timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the\n",
      "deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.  Nor can any son\n",
      "of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen\n",
      "intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him\n",
      "that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these\n",
      "horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot\n",
      "be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in\n",
      "his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.  Yet habit--strange\n",

      "those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually\n",

      "then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold\n",

      "shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.  It is worse; for you cannot sit\n",
      "motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking\n",
      "like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the\n",

      "he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.  But that gold\n",

      "business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen\n",
      "men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\n",
      "fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish\n",
      "corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at\n",
      "long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the\n",

      "Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's\n",

      "that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the\n",

      "end is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is\n",
      "made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having\n",

      "With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\n",
      "perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one\n",
      "iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,\n",
      "was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies\n",
      "of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,\n",
      "while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with\n",
      "all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild\n",
      "exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for\n",
      "his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its\n",
      "quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the\n",
      "bodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of\n",
      "furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc\n",
      "in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty\n",

      "oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which\n",

      "vial!\"  Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further\n",
      "hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with\n",

      "but a dim scrawl;--what's this?\"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck\n",
      "took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the\n",

      "almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated\n",
      "upon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the\n",
      "poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the\n",
      "water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On\n",
      "the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a\n",

      "\n",
      "Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the\n",

      "I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called\n",
      "in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas\n",
      "belted round his waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we\n",

      "narrow leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the\n",

      "then both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,\n",
      "it should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese\n",

      "disinterested and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg's best\n",
      "happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from\n",
      "the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half\n",
      "hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs\n",
      "would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.  But poor Queequeg, I\n",

      "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\n",
      "Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales\n",
      "regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two\n",
      "extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external\n",

      "deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance\n",
      "to study practical cetology than here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\n",
      "these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there\n",
      "is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the\n",
      "Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm\n",
      "Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\n",
      "superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present\n",
      "instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt\n",
      "colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\n",
      "large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically\n",
      "call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the\n",
      "two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side\n",
      "of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if\n",
      "you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you\n",
      "would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it\n",
      "to the magnitude of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the\n",
      "whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,\n",
      "for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey\n",
      "objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only\n",
      "command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\n",
      "side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your\n",
      "bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted\n",
      "in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he\n",
      "were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two\n",
      "backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\n",
      "fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,\n",
      "but his eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\n",
      "eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\n",
      "as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\n",
      "position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many\n",
      "cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great\n",
      "mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must\n",
      "wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.\n",
      "The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,\n",
      "and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be\n",
      "profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be\n",
      "said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined\n",
      "sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are\n",
      "separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing\n",
      "the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to\n",
      "be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader\n",
      "in some subsequent scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with\n",
      "a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of\n",
      "seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically\n",
      "seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's\n",
      "experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\n",
      "undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\n",
      "impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\n",
      "things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant\n",
      "of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.\n",
      "But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each\n",
      "by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,\n",
      "in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will\n",
      "be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,\n",
      "then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\n",
      "simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\n",
      "combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of\n",
      "time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\n",
      "him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then\n",
      "is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\n",
      "problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\n",
      "incongruity in this comparison.\n",

      "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\n",
      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n",

      "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve\n",

      "an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\n",
      "for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external\n",
      "leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a\n",
      "quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the\n",
      "eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be\n",

      "directly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for\n",
      "many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord\n",

      "barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments\n",
      "the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his\n",
      "foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be\n",
      "doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but\n",
      "reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under\n",
      "water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous\n",
      "surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000\n",
      "square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what\n",
      "an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even\n",
      "here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a\n",
      "whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!\n",
      "It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman\n",
      "has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with\n",
      "all their guns, and stores, and men on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\n",
      "into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\n",
      "sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its\n",
      "depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that\n",
      "silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing\n",
      "and wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were\n",
      "visible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin\n",
      "threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an\n",
      "eight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.\n",

      "suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to\n",
      "them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,\n",
      "so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,\n",
      "relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the\n",
      "boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a\n",
      "dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.\n",

      "\n",
      "The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth\n",
      "could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\n",
      "dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\n",
      "ship's lengths of the hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land\n",
      "animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their\n",
      "veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least\n",
      "instantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one\n",
      "of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure\n",
      "of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point\n",
      "as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole\n",
      "arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary\n",
      "pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may\n",
      "be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the\n",
      "quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\n",
      "fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a\n",
      "considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose\n",
      "source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.\n",
      "Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew\n",
      "over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they\n",
      "were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\n",
      "continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was\n",
      "only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture\n",
      "into the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no\n",
      "vital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they\n",
      "significantly call it, was untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\n",
      "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\n",
      "revealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,\n",
      "were beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of\n",
      "the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's\n",
      "eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable\n",
      "to see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one\n",
      "arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in\n",
      "order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and\n",
      "also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional\n",
      "inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last\n",
      "he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,\n",
      "the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there's no need of that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an\n",
      "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\n",
      "than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with\n",
      "swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their\n",
      "glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat\n",
      "and marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,\n",
      "so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from\n",
      "the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped\n",
      "with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a\n",
      "waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a\n",
      "log, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As\n",
      "when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some\n",
      "mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the\n",
      "spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying\n",
      "spout of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\n",
      "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\n",
      "Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at\n",
      "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\n",
      "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By\n",
      "very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\n",
      "transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\n",
      "stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially\n",
      "upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the\n",
      "spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in\n",
      "his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as\n",
      "the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of\n",
      "captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no\n",
      "prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must\n",
      "needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully\n",
      "to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was\n",
      "the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from\n",
      "the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted\n",
      "that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'\n",
      "West Indian long before America was discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\n",
      "cabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further\n",
      "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over\n",
      "sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing\n",
      "tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of\n",
      "affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,\n",
      "indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if\n",
      "still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the\n",
      "command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable\n",
      "strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables\n",
      "were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime\n",
      "everything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of\n",
      "the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The\n",
      "ship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks\n",
      "and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\n",
      "dislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon\n",
      "the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;\n",
      "and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could\n",
      "not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of\n",
      "ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on\n",
      "the point of going over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be in\n",
      "such a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do\n",
      "something or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your\n",
      "handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and\n",
      "cut the big chains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knife?  Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy\n",
      "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began\n",
      "slashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of\n",
      "sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.\n",
      "With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,\n",
      "the carcase sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\n",
      "accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\n",
      "surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\n",
      "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert\n",
      "that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the\n",
      "fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in\n",
      "him.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and\n",
      "swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm\n",
      "flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even\n",
      "these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\n",

      "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which\n",

      "answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we\n",
      "consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily\n",
      "lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough\n",
      "in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would\n",
      "accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\n",
      "players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a\n",

      "But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German\n",
      "exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating\n",
      "body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian\n",
      "campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.\n",
      "Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that\n",
      "when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway\n",
      "effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a\n",
      "whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \"The\n",

      "scientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in\n",
      "a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his\n",
      "nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to\n",
      "say, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,\n",
      "this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,\n",
      "by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without\n",
      "drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle\n",
      "of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his\n",
      "ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\n",
      "involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,\n",
      "when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated\n",
      "blood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,\n",
      "he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel\n",
      "crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for\n",
      "future use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact\n",
      "of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded\n",
      "upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I\n",
      "consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in\n",
      "HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I\n",
      "mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale\n",
      "will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his\n",
      "other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets\n",
      "seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\n",
      "rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,\n",
      "to a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,\n",
      "so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good\n",
      "his regular allowance of air.  And not till those seventy breaths are\n",
      "told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.\n",
      "Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are\n",
      "different; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale\n",
      "thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\n",
      "his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,\n",
      "too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all\n",
      "the fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could\n",
      "this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms\n",
      "beneath the sunlight.  Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the\n",
      "great necessities that strike the victory to thee!\n",
      "\n",
      "In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving\n",
      "for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has\n",
      "to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.\n",
      "But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\n",
      "if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\n",
      "then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\n",
      "smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\n",
      "all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\n",
      "clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\n",
      "of smelling.  But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be\n",
      "water or whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be\n",
      "arrived at on this head.  Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm\n",
      "Whale has no proper olfactories.  But what does he want of them?  No\n",
      "roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his\n",
      "spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is\n",
      "furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward\n",
      "retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the\n",
      "whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so\n",
      "strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what\n",
      "has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that\n",
      "had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out\n",
      "something by way of getting a living.  Oh! happy that the world is\n",
      "such an excellent listener!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\n",
      "for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\n",
      "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a\n",
      "little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe\n",
      "laid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question\n",
      "returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,\n",
      "whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled\n",
      "breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in\n",
      "at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain\n",
      "that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but\n",
      "it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\n",
      "through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing\n",
      "would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.\n",
      "But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he\n",
      "cannot spout even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very\n",
      "closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when\n",
      "unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his\n",
      "jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?  Speak\n",
      "out!  You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can\n",
      "you not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world it is not so\n",
      "easy to settle these plain things.  I have ever found your plain\n",
      "things the knottiest of all.  And as for this whale spout, you might\n",
      "almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist\n",
      "enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls\n",
      "from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a\n",
      "close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water\n",
      "cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that\n",
      "you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know\n",
      "that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know\n",
      "that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\n",
      "spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the\n",
      "whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day\n",
      "sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in\n",
      "the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of\n",
      "water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a\n",
      "cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching\n",
      "the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be\n",
      "peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your\n",
      "pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even\n",
      "when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the\n",
      "jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from\n",
      "the acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who\n",
      "coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\n",
      "scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin\n",
      "peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the\n",
      "spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I\n",
      "have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is\n",
      "fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.  The wisest thing\n",

      "Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.  My\n",
      "hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist.  And besides\n",
      "other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\n",
      "touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;\n",
      "I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an\n",
      "undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores;\n",
      "all other whales sometimes are.  He is both ponderous and profound.\n",
      "And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound\n",
      "beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on,\n",
      "there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act\n",
      "of thinking deep thoughts.  While composing a little treatise on\n",
      "Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere\n",
      "long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation\n",

      "while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin\n",
      "shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument\n",
      "for the above supposition.\n",

      "And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\n",
      "behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,\n",

      "incommunicable contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes\n",
      "see it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal\n",
      "upon his thoughts.  For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear\n",

      "enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.  And for this I thank God; for\n",

      "them, have intuitions.  Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions\n",

      "The Tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\n",
      "and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less\n",
      "celestial, I celebrate a tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point\n",
      "of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it\n",
      "comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty\n",
      "square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two\n",
      "broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less\n",
      "than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes\n",
      "slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,\n",
      "leaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of\n",
      "beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of\n",
      "these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the\n",
      "tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\n",
      "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,\n",
      "middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\n",
      "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\n",
      "crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much\n",
      "as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old\n",
      "Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the\n",
      "thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those\n",
      "wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so\n",
      "much to the great strength of the masonry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not\n",
      "enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and\n",
      "woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side\n",
      "the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with\n",
      "them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the\n",
      "confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to\n",
      "a point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to\n",
      "do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\n",
      "graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease\n",
      "undulates through a Titanism of power.  On the contrary, those\n",
      "motions derive their most appalling beauty from it.  Real strength\n",
      "never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in\n",
      "everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the\n",
      "magic.  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from\n",
      "the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.  As\n",
      "devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of\n",

      "they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\n",
      "hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most\n",
      "successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of\n",
      "all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,\n",

      "Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\n",
      "wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\n",
      "be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.\n",
      "Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five great motions are peculiar to it.  First, when used as a fin for\n",
      "progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in\n",
      "sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in\n",
      "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It\n",
      "never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.\n",
      "To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise\n",
      "coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,\n",
      "it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\n",
      "monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer\n",
      "by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in\n",
      "his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.\n",
      "In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and\n",
      "the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the\n",
      "unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is\n",
      "then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.\n",
      "Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\n",
      "through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy\n",
      "of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked\n",
      "rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\n",
      "generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so\n",
      "often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's\n",
      "play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\n",
      "elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\n",
      "the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
      "whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary\n",
      "touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\n",
      "bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the\n",
      "flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to\n",
      "damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a\n",
      "pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in\n",
      "his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\n",
      "in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of\n",
      "the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\n",
      "corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as\n",
      "if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The\n",
      "broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting\n",
      "the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would\n",
      "almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the\n",
      "light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\n",
      "would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the\n",
      "flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then\n",
      "completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to\n",
      "plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of\n",
      "his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a\n",
      "moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime\n",
      "BREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's\n",
      "flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated\n",
      "nature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems\n",
      "spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I\n",
      "seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from\n",
      "the flame Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in\n",
      "all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to\n",
      "you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head\n",
      "of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a\n",
      "large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and\n",
      "for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed\n",
      "to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods\n",
      "was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.\n",
      "As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then\n",
      "testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\n",
      "beings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of\n",
      "antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the\n",
      "profoundest silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\n",
      "elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\n",
      "of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two\n",
      "opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\n",
      "respectively belong.  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier\n",
      "to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but\n",
      "the stalk of a lily.  The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk\n",
      "were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush\n",
      "and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated\n",

      "the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the\n",
      "Siamese!  So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along,\n",

      "Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our\n",

      "hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.  But when the\n",
      "swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase;\n",
      "how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding\n",
      "her on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to\n",
      "her, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced\n",
      "the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and\n",
      "in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such\n",
      "fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green\n",
      "walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and\n",
      "bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,\n",
      "and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing\n",
      "and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of\n",
      "remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were\n",
      "infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these\n",
      "conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and\n",
      "ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been\n",
      "gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\n",
      "when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\n",
      "Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\n",
      "side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\n",
      "harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\n",
      "gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\n",
      "victoriously gained upon the Malays.  But still driving on in the\n",
      "wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed;\n",
      "gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was\n",
      "passed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some\n",
      "presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of\n",
      "the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their\n",
      "rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\n",
      "battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of\n",
      "stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\n",
      "after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\n",
      "chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave\n",
      "animating token that they were now at last under the influence of\n",
      "that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the\n",
      "fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The\n",
      "compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and\n",
      "steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\n",
      "like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\n",
      "seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in\n",
      "vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by\n",
      "their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction\n",
      "of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their\n",
      "number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like\n",
      "water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been\n",
      "but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce\n",
      "wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.\n",
      "But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding\n",
      "creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the\n",
      "lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary\n",
      "horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together\n",
      "in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest\n",
      "alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\n",
      "trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.\n",
      "Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied\n",
      "whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth\n",
      "which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced\n",
      "nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is\n",
      "customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making\n",
      "for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about\n",
      "three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\n",
      "darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\n",
      "light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a\n",
      "movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is\n",
      "in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less\n",
      "anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\n",
      "vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you\n",
      "deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\n",
      "circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power\n",
      "of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;\n",
      "as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we\n",
      "flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset\n",
      "boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving\n",
      "to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at\n",
      "what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging\n",
      "away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while\n",
      "all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking\n",
      "out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for\n",
      "there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite\n",
      "idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\n",
      "They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  \"Out of\n",
      "the way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden\n",
      "rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp\n",
      "us.  \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another,\n",
      "which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his\n",
      "own fan-like extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\n",
      "invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares\n",
      "of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they\n",
      "cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable\n",
      "length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other\n",
      "end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a\n",
      "harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.\n",
      "For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly\n",
      "chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;\n",
      "while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot\n",
      "kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\n",
      "afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like\n",
      "these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with\n",
      "three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we\n",
      "saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\n",
      "sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like\n",
      "malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in\n",
      "the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under\n",
      "one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and\n",
      "carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the\n",
      "seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the\n",
      "wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,\n",
      "and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\n",
      "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n",
      "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.\n",
      "So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing\n",
      "whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\n",
      "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of\n",
      "the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\n",
      "valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the\n",
      "outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse\n",
      "the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,\n",
      "produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more\n",
      "quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say\n",
      "lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted\n",
      "distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\n",
      "saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going\n",
      "round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so\n",
      "closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might\n",
      "easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on\n",
      "their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,\n",
      "more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\n",
      "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch\n",
      "for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had\n",
      "only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of\n",
      "the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;\n",
      "the women and children of this routed host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n",
      "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods\n",
      "in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,\n",
      "embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or\n",
      "three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a\n",
      "time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low\n",
      "boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I\n",
      "mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had\n",
      "been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide\n",
      "extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the\n",
      "precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,\n",
      "unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it\n",
      "may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our\n",
      "becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous\n",
      "fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it\n",
      "was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came\n",
      "snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till\n",
      "it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.\n",
      "Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with\n",
      "his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained\n",
      "from darting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and\n",
      "still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,\n",
      "suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\n",
      "mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed\n",
      "shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a\n",
      "considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants\n",
      "while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as\n",
      "if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing\n",
      "mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\n",
      "reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up\n",
      "towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in\n",
      "their new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also\n",
      "seemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from\n",

      "harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\n",

      "concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\n",
      "Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.\n",
      "According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under\n",
      "cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he\n",
      "pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter\n",
      "any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.  He was a\n",
      "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,\n",
      "with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton\n",
      "velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb\n",
      "was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once\n",
      "ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\n",
      "\"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish\n",
      "to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\n",
      "captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\n",
      "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from\n",
      "a blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\n",
      "carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a\n",
      "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he's a\n",
      "baboon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\n",
      "is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he\n",
      "conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",
      "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\n",
      "loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in\n",
      "fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps\n",
      "somebody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service\n",
      "to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\n",
      "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down\n",
      "into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the\n",
      "interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink\n",
      "with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;\n",
      "but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then\n",
      "Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from\n",
      "these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,\n",
      "hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line\n",
      "in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out\n",
      "the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the\n",
      "Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,\n",
      "Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\n",
      "ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the\n",
      "whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,\n",
      "while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.  Whereupon\n",
      "Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to\n",
      "give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of\n",
      "his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced\n",
      "an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would\n",
      "almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and\n",
      "when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like\n",
      "turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.\n",
      "His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their\n",
      "chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n",
      "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was\n",
      "beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay\n",
      "increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,\n",
      "there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide\n",
      "of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow\n",
      "into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for\n",
      "a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\n",
      "in the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\n",
      "something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\n",
      "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it\n",
      "with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And\n",
      "this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\n",
      "druggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\n",
      "lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured\n",
      "were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and\n",
      "come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\n",
      "an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\n",
      "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on\n",
      "that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively\n",
      "late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber\n",
      "itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but\n",
      "the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\n",
      "distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also\n",
      "dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\n",
      "except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,\n",
      "odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n",
      "ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\n",
      "spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\n",
      "candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and\n",
      "also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\n",
      "carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few\n",
      "grains into claret, to flavor it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\n",
      "regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\n",
      "sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\n",
      "cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How\n",
      "to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\n",
      "three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out\n",
      "of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\n",
      "certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might\n",
      "be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they\n",
      "were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\n",
      "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of\n",
      "that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and\n",
      "incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.\n",
      "And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is\n",
      "that maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of\n",
      "all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental\n",
      "manufacturing stages, is the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\n",
      "cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\n",
      "whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\n",
      "might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\n",
      "of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the\n",
      "slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling\n",
      "is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another\n",
      "thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how\n",
      "did this odious stigma originate?\n",
      "\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.\n",
      "Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their\n",
      "oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the\n",
      "fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of\n",
      "large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the\n",
      "season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which\n",
      "they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,\n",
      "that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale\n",
      "cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat\n",
      "similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for\n",
      "the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in\n",
      "former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,\n",
      "which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in\n",
      "his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name\n",
      "imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in\n",
      "order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\n",
      "be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.\n",
      "It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when\n",
      "the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very\n",
      "pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea\n",
      "Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after\n",
      "completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\n",
      "fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it\n",
      "is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or\n",
      "dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\n",
      "creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people\n",
      "of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the\n",
      "nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\n",
      "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\n",
      "abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\n",
      "seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's\n",
      "flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady\n",
      "rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the\n",
      "Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not\n",
      "be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with\n",

      "driven in one eccentric span.  But while hapless Dough-Boy was by\n",
      "nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over\n",
      "tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,\n",
      "genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever\n",
      "enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any\n",
      "other race.  For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but\n",

      "Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for\n",
      "even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,\n",
      "panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's\n",
      "peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he\n",
      "had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred\n",
      "his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus\n",
      "temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly\n",
      "illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to\n",
      "ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County\n",
      "in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the\n",
      "green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the\n",
      "round horizon into one star-belled tambourine.  So, though in the\n",
      "clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\n",
      "pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\n",
      "jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\n",
      "lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the\n",
      "sun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery\n",
      "effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once\n",
      "the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\n",
      "stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman\n",
      "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n",
      "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n",
      "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb\n",
      "observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his\n",
      "courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack\n",
      "whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with\n",
      "him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the\n",
      "water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the\n",
      "line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up\n",
      "to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,\n",
      "which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less\n",
      "than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",
      "saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\n",
      "by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\n",
      "business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\n",
      "and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The\n",
      "substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest\n",
      "was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,\n",
      "STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will\n",
      "sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,\n",
      "as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\n",
      "conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\n",
      "margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,\n",
      "and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or\n",
      "by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't\n",
      "afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\n",
      "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and\n",
      "don't jump any more.\"  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\n",
      "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\n",
      "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It\n",
      "was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but\n",
      "this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale\n",
      "started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\n",
      "traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It\n",
      "was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and\n",
      "cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\n",
      "gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and\n",
      "down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No\n",
      "boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's\n",
      "inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In\n",
      "three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and\n",
      "Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,\n",
      "curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the\n",
      "loftiest and the brightest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n",
      "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the\n",
      "awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self\n",
      "in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?\n",
      "Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark\n",
      "how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?\n",
      "No; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in\n",
      "his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come\n",
      "up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such\n",
      "considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own\n",
      "timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar\n",
      "instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost\n",
      "invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the\n",
      "same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\n",

      "standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed\n",
      "to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own\n",
      "boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,\n",
      "fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious\n",

      "\"Hast seen the White Whale!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\n",

      "excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of\n",
      "his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but\n",
      "his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy\n",
      "mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\n",
      "rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,\n",
      "it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost\n",
      "hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a\n",
      "boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up\n",
      "towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down\n",
      "to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of\n",
      "course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab\n",
      "now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;\n",
      "hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope\n",

      "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\n",
      "circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\n",
      "luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.\n",
      "And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of\n",
      "the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\n",
      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him\n",
      "a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not\n",
      "seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a\n",
      "cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only\n",
      "lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance\n",
      "how affairs stood, cried out, \"I see, I see!--avast heaving there!\n",
      "Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or\n",
      "two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\n",
      "curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the\n",
      "end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it\n",
      "all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like\n",
      "sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),\n",
      "and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time\n",
      "also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon\n",
      "one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung\n",
      "inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.\n",
      "With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\n",
      "advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory\n",
      "arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye,\n",
      "aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm\n",
      "that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The White Whale,\" said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm\n",

      "been a telescope; \"there I saw him, on the Line, last season.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he took that arm off, did he?\" asked Ahab, now sliding down from\n",

      "\"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\"\n",
      "began the Englishman.  \"I was ignorant of the White Whale at that\n",
      "time.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and\n",
      "my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,\n",
      "that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could\n",
      "only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.\n",
      "Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\n",

      "wrinkles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was he, it was he!\" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons,\" cried Ahab, exultingly--\"but\n",
      "on!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me a chance, then,\" said the Englishman, good-humoredly.\n",
      "\"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs\n",
      "all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my\n",
      "fast-line!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I\n",
      "know him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How it was exactly,\" continued the one-armed commander, \"I do not\n",
      "know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\n",
      "somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards\n",
      "pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of\n",
      "the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing\n",
      "how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest\n",
      "and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,\n",
      "spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the\n",
      "hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to\n",
      "might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a\n",
      "whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's\n",
      "boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;\n",
      "Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's\n",
      "boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and\n",
      "snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.\n",
      "But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next\n",
      "instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged\n",
      "and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up\n",
      "out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use\n",
      "sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding\n",
      "sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second\n",
      "iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,\n",
      "cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes\n",
      "first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all\n",
      "chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I\n",
      "seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment\n",
      "clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,\n",
      "and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,\n",
      "went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron\n",
      "towing along near me caught me here\" (clapping his hand just below\n",
      "his shoulder); \"yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to\n",
      "Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the\n",
      "good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the\n",
      "whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I\n",
      "floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the\n",

      "The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all\n",
      "the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote\n",
      "his gentlemanly rank on board.  His face was an exceedingly round but\n",
      "sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\n",
      "patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention\n",
      "between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in\n",
      "the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs\n",
      "of the two crippled captains.  But, at his superior's introduction of\n",

      "spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse\n",
      "and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon\n",
      "ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long.  I measured it\n",
      "with the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was\n",
      "threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that\n",
      "ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule\"--pointing at it with\n",
      "the marlingspike--\"that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered\n",
      "the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the\n",
      "end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine\n",
      "once.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.  Do ye see this\n",
      "dent, sir\"--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and\n",
      "exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the\n",
      "slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a\n",
      "wound--\"Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here;\n",
      "he knows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't,\" said the captain, \"but his mother did; he was born\n",
      "with it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was there ever such\n",
      "another Bunger in the watery world?  Bunger, when you die, you ought\n",

      "\"What became of the White Whale?\" now cried Ahab, who thus far had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried the one-armed captain, \"oh, yes!  Well; after he sounded,\n",

      "didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\n",
      "till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard\n",
      "about Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he.\"\n",

      "\"Did'st thou cross his wake again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But could not fasten?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough?  What should I do\n",
      "without this other arm?  And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so\n",
      "much as he swallows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" interrupted Bunger, \"give him your left arm for bait to\n",
      "get the right.  Do you know, gentlemen\"--very gravely and\n",
      "mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--\"Do you know,\n",
      "gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably\n",
      "constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him\n",
      "to completely digest even a man's arm?  And he knows it too.  So that\n",
      "what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness.\n",
      "For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to\n",
      "terrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,\n",

      "In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\n",
      "Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\n",
      "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\n",
      "fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two\n",
      "feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some\n",
      "fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for\n",

      "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n",
      "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\n",
      "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\n",
      "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was\n",
      "nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n",
      "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\n",
      "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From\n",
      "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last\n",
      "only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they\n",
      "all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs\n",

      "that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,\n",
      "muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here\n",

      "his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.\n",
      "Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings\n",

      "For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain\n",

      "no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,\n",
      "shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;\n",

      "lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic\n",
      "significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their\n",

      "strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\n",

      "been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\n",
      "uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\n",

      "along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,\n",
      "also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of\n",

      "breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he\n",

      "\n",
      "But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\n",
      "that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;\n",
      "soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,\n",
      "when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,\n",
      "that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical\n",
      "moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was\n",
      "leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he\n",
      "could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live\n",
      "or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He\n",
      "answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a\n",
      "man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:\n",
      "nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\n",

      "old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a\n",

      "about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who\n",
      "had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree\n",
      "approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the\n",
      "look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this\n",

      "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\n",
      "head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a\n",

      "That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at\n",
      "intervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and\n",
      "went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,\n",
      "snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing\n",
      "nigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near.\n",
      "Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by\n",
      "the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any\n",
      "mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the\n",
      "dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as\n",
      "nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be\n",
      "slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently\n",
      "vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea\n",
      "directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the\n",
      "pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like\n",
      "marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man the mast-heads!  Call all hands!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the\n",
      "forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps\n",
      "that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did\n",
      "they appear with their clothes in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What d'ye see?\" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, nothing sir!\" was the sound hailing down in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"T'gallant sails!--stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\n",
      "swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they\n",
      "were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way\n",
      "aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between\n",
      "the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in\n",
      "the air.  \"There she blows!--there she blows!  A hump like a\n",
      "snow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\n",
      "look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\n",
      "whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his final\n",
      "perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\n",
      "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's\n",
      "head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the\n",
      "whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea\n",
      "revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent\n",
      "spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same\n",
      "silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and\n",
      "Indian Oceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And did none of ye see it before?\" cried Ahab, hailing the perched\n",
      "men all around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and\n",
      "I cried out,\" said Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\n",
      "reserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have raised\n",
      "the White Whale first.  There she blows!--there she blows!--there\n",
      "she blows!  There again!--there again!\" he cried, in long-drawn,\n",
      "lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the\n",
      "whale's visible jets.  \"He's going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down\n",
      "top-gallant-sails!  Stand by three boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,\n",
      "stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!\n",
      "So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!\n",
      "All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!  Lower me, Mr.\n",
      "Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!\" and he slid through the air\n",
      "to the deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is heading straight to leeward, sir,\" cried Stubb, \"right away\n",
      "from us; cannot have seen the ship yet.\"\n",

      "\"Be dumb, man!  Stand by the braces!  Hard down the helm!--brace up!\n",
      "Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that!  Boats, boats!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails\n",
      "set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\n",
      "leeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up\n",
      "Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the\n",
      "sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the\n",
      "ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;\n",
      "seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the\n",
      "breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his\n",
      "entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as\n",
      "if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of\n",
      "finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of\n",
      "the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft\n",
      "Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his\n",
      "broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\n",
      "shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\n",
      "the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\n",
      "bubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by\n",
      "the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,\n",
      "alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff\n",
      "rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered\n",
      "pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at\n",
      "intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and\n",
      "fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked\n",
      "on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,\n",
      "invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away\n",
      "with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,\n",
      "leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching\n",
      "fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not\n",
      "Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White\n",
      "Whale as he so divinely swam.\n",
      "\n",
      "On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once\n",
      "leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale\n",
      "shed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters\n",
      "who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had\n",
      "ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the\n",
      "vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou\n",
      "glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how\n",
      "many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,\n",
      "among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,\n",
      "Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of\n",
      "his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his\n",
      "jaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for\n",
      "an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like\n",
      "Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes\n",
      "in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of\n",
      "sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white\n",
      "sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\n",
      "the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's\n",
      "reappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he\n",
      "gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide\n",
      "wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his\n",
      "eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.\n",
      "The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The birds!--the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\n",
      "now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began\n",
      "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with\n",
      "joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab\n",
      "could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down\n",
      "and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no\n",
      "bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\n",
      "magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\n",
      "revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating\n",
      "up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and\n",
      "scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\n",
      "blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\n",
      "an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his\n",
      "steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\n",
      "apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\n",
      "went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his\n",
      "crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\n",
      "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\n",
      "under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with\n",
      "that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\n",
      "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\n",
      "lengthwise beneath the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\n",
      "for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\n",
      "of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within\n",
      "his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high\n",
      "up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The\n",
      "bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\n",
      "Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the\n",
      "White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\n",
      "mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;\n",
      "but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to\n",
      "gain the uttermost stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as\n",
      "the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and\n",
      "from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be\n",
      "darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as\n",
      "it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a\n",
      "quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac\n",
      "Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed\n",
      "him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with\n",
      "all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\n",
      "strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,\n",
      "the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\n",
      "snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\n",
      "bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again\n",
      "in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated\n",
      "aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging\n",
      "to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them\n",
      "across.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the\n",
      "first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his\n",
      "head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment\n",
      "his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.\n",
      "But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over\n",
      "sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;\n",
      "spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\n",
      "flat-faced upon the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in\n",
      "the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled\n",
      "body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or\n",
      "more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their\n",
      "confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing\n",
      "their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the\n",
      "but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the\n",
      "Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its\n",
      "designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\n",
      "up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\n",
      "pitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must\n",
      "best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly\n",
      "round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his\n",
      "vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more\n",
      "deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden\n",
      "him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's\n",
      "elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in\n",
      "the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to\n",
      "swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a\n",
      "whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed\n",
      "bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's\n",
      "fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the\n",
      "clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more\n",
      "than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so\n",
      "revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so\n",
      "planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he\n",
      "seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,\n",
      "unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the\n",
      "eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\n",
      "destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\n",
      "case could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,\n",
      "then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose\n",
      "centre had now become the old man's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the\n",
      "ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon\n",
      "the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed\n",
      "her!--\"Sail on the\"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him\n",
      "from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of\n",
      "it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he\n",
      "shouted,--\"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\n",
      "she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he\n",
      "sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\n",
      "brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily\n",
      "strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for\n",
      "a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one\n",
      "trodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails\n",
      "came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the\n",
      "more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes\n",
      "condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains\n",
      "kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.  And so, such\n",
      "hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods\n",
      "decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly\n",
      "made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless\n",
      "centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of\n",
      "inferior souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The harpoon,\" said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\n",
      "one bended arm--\"is it safe?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\" said Stubb, showing\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lay it before me;--any missing men?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.  So, so, I see him!\n",
      "there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands\n",
      "off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!  Set the\n",
      "sail; out oars; the helm!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being\n",
      "picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the\n",
      "chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It\n",
      "was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the\n",
      "added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his\n",
      "every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if\n",
      "now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an\n",
      "indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew\n",
      "endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining\n",
      "at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief\n",
      "vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered\n",
      "the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.\n",
      "Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to\n",
      "their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\n",
      "previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,\n",
      "and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with\n",
      "stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod\n",
      "bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,\n",
      "methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly\n",
      "announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported\n",
      "as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the\n",
      "deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\n",
      "allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--\"Whose is the doubloon\n",
      "now?  D'ye see him?\" and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he\n",
      "commanded them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore\n",
      "on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the\n",
      "planks.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\n",
      "aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to\n",
      "a still greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched\n",
      "hat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been\n",
      "dropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to\n",
      "shattered stern.  At last he paused before it; and as in an already\n",
      "over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across,\n",
      "so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as\n",
      "this.\n",

      "Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to\n",
      "evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place\n",
      "in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck\n",

      "others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on\n",
      "the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready\n",
      "and ripe for their fate.  Ah! how they still strove through that\n",

      "belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an\n",
      "orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges\n",
      "of rifles.  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard,\n",

      "calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic\n",
      "fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;\n",
      "but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with\n",
      "his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus\n",
      "booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a\n",
      "mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven\n",
      "miles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes\n",

      "defiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his\n",
      "immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\n",
      "Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\n",
      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\n",
      "for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\n",
      "stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\n",
      "intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour\n",
      "and thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at\n",
      "the fore.  The boats!--stand by!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\n",
      "shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\n",
      "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\n",
      "from his perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare\n",
      "one, rigged the afternoon previous.  \"Mr. Starbuck, the ship is\n",
      "thine--keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the\n",
      "first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for\n",
      "the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he\n",
      "told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull\n",
      "straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a\n",
      "certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the\n",
      "whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and\n",
      "while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his\n",
      "eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in\n",
      "an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a\n",
      "lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of\n",
      "the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on\n",
      "annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But\n",
      "skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in\n",
      "the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by\n",
      "a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore\n",
      "every other cry but his to shreds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\n",
      "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the\n",
      "three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of\n",
      "themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in\n",
      "him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to\n",
      "rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab\n",
      "first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking\n",
      "in upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some\n",
      "snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of\n",
      "sharks!\n",
      "\n",
      "Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\n",
      "harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came\n",
      "flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.\n",
      "Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically\n",
      "reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;\n",
      "dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and\n",
      "then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the\n",
      "intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.\n",
      "That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining\n",
      "tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the\n",
      "more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed\n",
      "them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and\n",
      "then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,\n",
      "in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced\n",
      "round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of\n",
      "punch.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out\n",
      "after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,\n",
      "while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,\n",
      "twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and\n",
      "Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while\n",
      "the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the\n",
      "creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness\n",
      "of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed\n",
      "drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting\n",
      "perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad\n",
      "forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into\n",
      "the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men\n",
      "struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as\n",
      "he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a\n",
      "little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and\n",
      "with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his\n",
      "flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the\n",
      "least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly\n",
      "drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if\n",
      "satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated\n",
      "forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled\n",
      "lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\n",
      "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\n",
      "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\n",
      "and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,\n",
      "wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\n",
      "inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all\n",
      "these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have\n",
      "befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now\n",
      "found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a\n",
      "comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous\n",
      "day's mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;\n",
      "as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the\n",
      "shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist\n",
      "him.  His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even\n",

      "lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping\n",
      "veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then\n",
      "fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the\n",

      "once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from\n",

      "round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns\n",
      "in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions\n",
      "of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;\n",

      "now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the\n",
      "ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to\n",

      "were busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through\n",
      "the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb\n",
      "and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and\n",
      "lances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken\n",
      "boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But\n",
      "he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the\n",
      "main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that\n",
      "perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and\n",
      "so nail it to the mast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance\n",

      "smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled\n",
      "round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\n",
      "with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\n",
      "poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\n",

      "sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically\n",

      "it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the\n",
      "elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once\n",
      "more have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, three of the\n",
      "oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were\n",
      "therefore unprepared for its effects--these were flung out; but so\n",
      "fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and\n",
      "rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily\n",
      "inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still\n",
      "afloat and swimming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\n",
      "instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\n",
      "sea.  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\n",
      "the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on\n",
      "their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the\n",

      "seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking\n",
      "it--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down\n",
      "upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead.  \"I grow blind; hands!\n",

      "\n",
      "In the execution of its purpose to give educational value and moral worth\n",
      "to the recreational activities of the boyhood of America, the leaders of\n",
      "the Boy Scout Movement quickly learned that to effectively carry out its\n",
      "program, the boy must be influenced not only in his out-of-door life but\n",
      "also in the diversions of his other leisure moments. It is at such times\n",
      "that the boy is captured by the tales of daring enterprises and\n",
      "adventurous good times. What now is needful is not that his taste should\n",
      "be thwarted but trained. There should constantly be presented to him the\n",
      "books the boy likes best, yet always the books that will be best for the\n",
      "boy. As a matter of fact, however, the boy's taste is being constantly\n",
      "vitiated and exploited by the great mass of cheap juvenile literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help anxiously concerned parents and educators to meet this grave\n",
      "peril, the Library Commission of the Boy Scouts of America has been\n",
      "organized. EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY is the result of their labors. All the\n",
      "books chosen have been approved by them. The Commission is composed of the\n",
      "following members: George F. Bowerman, Librarian, Public Library of the\n",
      "District of Columbia, Washington, D. C.; Harrison W. Graver, Librarian,\n",
      "Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Pa.; Claude G. Leland, Superintendent,\n",
      "Bureau of Libraries, Board of Education, New York City; Edward F.\n",

      "together with the Editorial Board of our Movement, William D. Murray,\n",

      "\n",
      "In selecting the books, the Commission has chosen only such as are of\n",
      "interest to boys, the first twenty-five being either works of fiction or\n",
      "stirring stories of adventurous experiences. In later lists, books of a\n",
      "more serious sort will be included. It is hoped that as many as\n",
      "twenty-five may be added to the Library each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks are due the several publishers who have helped to inaugurate this\n",
      "new department of our work. Without their co-operation in making available\n",

      "The Commission invites suggestions as to future books to be included in\n",
      "the Library. Librarians, teachers, parents, and all others interested in\n",
      "welfare work for boys, can render a unique service by forwarding to\n",

      "Railroad Blake, fellows! 'Rah, 'rah, 'rah, and a tigah! Good for you, Rod\n",

      "\n",
      "Amid a thousand such cries as these, from the throats of the excited boys\n",
      "and a furious waving of hats, handkerchiefs, and ribbon-decked parasols\n",
      "from the grand stand, the greatest bicycling event of the year so far as\n",
      "Euston was concerned, was finished, and Rodman Blake was declared winner\n",
      "of the Railroad Cup. It was the handsomest thing of the kind ever seen in\n",
      "that part of the country, and had been presented to the Steel Wheel Club\n",
      "of Euston by President Vanderveer of the great New York and Western\n",
      "Railroad, who made his summer home at that place. The race for this trophy\n",
      "was the principal event at the annual meet of the club, which always took\n",
      "place on the first Wednesday of September. If any member won it three\n",
      "years in succession it was to be his to keep, and every winner was\n",
      "entitled to have his name engraved on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snyder Appleby or \"Cider Apples\" as the boys, with their love for\n",
      "nicknames, sometimes called him, had won it two years in succession, and\n",
      "was confident of doing the same thing this year. He had just obtained,\n",
      "through President Vanderveer, a position in the office of the Railroad\n",
      "Company, and only waited to ride this last race for the \"Railroad Cup,\"\n",
      "as it was called in honor of its donor, before going to the city and\n",
      "entering upon his new duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to be beaten so badly, and by that young upstart, for so he called\n",
      "Rod Blake, was a mortification almost too great to be borne. As Snyder\n",
      "left the track without finishing the last race and made his way to the\n",
      "dressing-room under the grand stand, he ground his teeth, and vowed to get\n",
      "even with his victorious rival yet. The cheers and yells of delight with\n",
      "which the fellows were hailing the victor, made him feel his defeat all\n",
      "the more bitterly, and seek the more eagerly for some plan for that\n",
      "victor's humiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snyder Appleby was generally considered by the boys as one of the meanest\n",
      "fellows in Euston, and that is the reason why they called him \"Cider\n",
      "Apples\"; for those, as everybody knows, are most always the very poorest\n",
      "of the picking. So the name seemed to be appropriate, as well as a happy\n",
      "parody on that to which he was really entitled. He was the son, or rather\n",
      "the adopted son, of Major Arms Appleby, who, next to President Vanderveer,\n",
      "was the richest man in Euston, and lived in the great, rambling stone\n",
      "mansion that had been in his family for generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Major, who was a bachelor, was also one of the kindest-hearted, most\n",
      "generous, and most obstinate of men. He loved to do good deeds; but he\n",
      "loved to do them in his own way, and his way was certain to be the one\n",
      "that was contrary to the advice of everybody else. Thus it happened that\n",
      "he determined to adopt the year-old baby boy who was left on his doorstep\n",
      "one stormy night, a little more than sixteen years before this story\n",
      "opens. He was not fond of babies, nor did he care to have children about\n",
      "him. Simply because everybody advised him to send this one to the county\n",
      "house, where it might be cared for by the proper authorities, he declared\n",
      "he would do nothing of the kind; but would adopt the little waif and bring\n",
      "him up as his own son.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boy grew, and developed many undesirable traits of character, Major\n",
      "Appleby was too kind-hearted to see them, and too obstinate to be warned\n",
      "against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't tell me,\" he would say, \"I know more about the boy than anybody\n",
      "else, and am fully capable of forming my opinion concerning him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Snyder Appleby, as he was called, because the name \"Snyder\" was\n",
      "found marked on the basket in which he had been left at the Major's door,\n",
      "grew up with the fixed idea that if he only pleased his adopted father\n",
      "he might act about as he chose with everybody else. Now he was nearly\n",
      "eighteen years of age, big and strong, with a face that, but for its\n",
      "coarseness, would have been called handsome. He was fond of display, did\n",
      "everything for effect, was intolerably lazy, had no idea of the word\n",
      "punctuality, and never kept an engagement unless he felt inclined to do\n",
      "so. He always had plenty of pocket money which he spent lavishly, and was\n",
      "not without a certain degree of popularity among the other boys of Euston.\n",
      "He had subscribed more largely than anybody else to the Steel Wheel Club\n",
      "upon its formation, and had thus succeeded in having himself elected its\n",
      "captain.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was older and stronger than any of the other members who took up\n",
      "racing, and as he always rode the lightest and best wheel that money could\n",
      "procure, he had, without much hard work, easily maintained a lead in the\n",
      "racing field, and had come to consider himself as invincible. He regarded\n",
      "himself as such a sure winner of this last race for the Railroad Cup,\n",
      "that he had not taken the trouble to go into training for it. He would not\n",
      "even give up his cigarette smoking, a habit that he had acquired because\n",
      "he considered it fashionable and manly. Now he was beaten, disgracefully,\n",
      "and that by a boy nearly two years younger than himself. It was too much,\n",
      "and he determined to find some excuse for his defeat, that should at the\n",
      "same time remove the disgrace from him, and place it upon other shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rodman Ray Blake, or R. R. Blake as he signed his name, and \"Railroad\n",
      "Blake\" as the boys often called him, was Major Appleby's nephew, and the\n",
      "son of his only sister. She had married an impecunious young artist\n",
      "against her brother's wish, on which account he had declined ever to see\n",
      "her again. When she died, after two years of poverty-stricken widowhood,\n",
      "she left a loving, forgiving letter for her brother, and in it committed\n",
      "her darling boy to his charge. If she had not done this, but had trusted\n",
      "to his generous impulses, all would have gone well, and the events that\n",
      "serve to make up this story would never have taken place. As it was, the\n",
      "Major, feeling that the boy was forced upon him, was greatly aggrieved.\n",
      "That the lad should bear a remarkable resemblance to his handsome artist\n",
      "father also irritated him. As a result, while he really became very fond\n",
      "of the boy, and was never unkind to him, he treated him with an assumed\n",
      "indifference that was keenly felt by the loving, high-spirited lad. As for\n",
      "Snyder Appleby, he was jealous of Rodman from the very first; and when,\n",
      "only a short time before the race meeting of the Steel Wheel Club, the\n",
      "latter was almost unanimously elected to his place as captain, this\n",
      "feeling was greatly increased.\n",

      "\n",
      "A RACE FOR THE RAILROAD CUP.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Blake had now been in Euston two years, and was, among the boys,\n",
      "decidedly the most popular fellow in the place. He was a slightly-built\n",
      "chap; but with muscles like steel wires, and possessed of wonderful\n",
      "agility and powers of endurance. He excelled in all athletic sports, was a\n",
      "capital boxer, and at the same time found little difficulty in maintaining\n",
      "a good rank in his classes. He had taken to bicycling from the very first,\n",
      "and quickly became an expert rider, though he had never gone in for\n",
      "racing. It was therefore a great surprise, even to his friends, when, on\n",
      "the very day before the race meeting, he entered his name for the event\n",
      "that was to result in the winning or losing of the Railroad Cup. It would\n",
      "not have been so much of a surprise had anybody known of his conversation,\n",
      "a few weeks before, with Eltje Vanderveer, the railroad president's only\n",
      "daughter. She was a few months younger than Rod, and ever since he had\n",
      "jumped into the river to save her pet kitten from drowning, they had been\n",
      "fast friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when in talking of the approaching meeting, Eltje had said, \"How I\n",
      "wish you were a racer, and could win our cup, Rod,\" the boy instantly made\n",
      "up his mind to try for it. He only answered, \"Do you? Well, perhaps I may\n",
      "go in for that sort of thing some time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he began training, so secretly that nobody but Dan, a stable boy on\n",
      "his uncle's place and Rod's most ardent admirer, was aware of it; but with\n",
      "such steady determination that on the eventful day of the great race his\n",
      "physical condition was very nearly perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was on hand at the race track bright and early; for, as captain of the\n",
      "club, Rod had a great deal to do in seeing that everything went smoothly,\n",
      "and in starting on time the dozen events that preceded the race for the\n",
      "Railroad Cup, which came last on the programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these earlier events were being run off Snyder Appleby, faultlessly\n",
      "attired, sat in the grand stand beside his adopted father, and directly\n",
      "behind President Vanderveer and his pretty daughter, to whom he tried to\n",
      "render himself especially agreeable. He listened respectfully to the\n",
      "Major's stories, made amusing comments on the racers for Eltje's benefit,\n",
      "and laughed heartily at the puns that her father was given to making.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how about your own race, Mr. Appleby?\" asked Eltje. \"Don't you feel\n",
      "any anxiety concerning it? It is to be the hardest one of all, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Immensely flattered at being addressed as Mister Appleby, Snyder replied\n",
      "carelessly, \"Oh, yes! of course I am most anxious to win it, especially as\n",
      "you are here to see it run; but I don't anticipate much difficulty. Bliss\n",
      "is a hard man to beat; but I have done it before, and I guess I can do it\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you don't think Rodman has any chance of winning?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, hardly. You see this is his first race, and experience goes a long\n",
      "way in such affairs. Still, he rides well, and it wouldn't surprise me to\n",
      "see him make a good third at the finish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Eltje smiled as she answered, \"Perhaps he will finish third; but it would\n",
      "surprise me greatly to see him do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This pretty girl, with the Dutch name, had such faith in her friend Rod,\n",
      "that she did not believe he would ever be third, or even second, where he\n",
      "had once made up his mind to be first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Failing to catch her real meaning, Snyder replied: \"Of course he may not\n",
      "do as well as that; but he ought to. As captain of the club he ought to\n",
      "sustain the honor of his position, you know. If he doesn't feel able to\n",
      "take at least third place in a five-starter race, he should either resign,\n",
      "or keep out of the racing field altogether. Now I must leave you; for I\n",
      "see I am wanted. You'll wish me good luck, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" answered Eltje mischievously, \"I wish you all the luck you\n",
      "deserve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Forced to be content with this answer, but wondering if there was any\n",
      "hidden meaning in it, Snyder left the grand stand, and strolled leisurely\n",
      "around to the dressing-room, lighting a cigarette as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurry up!\" shouted Rod, who was the soul of punctuality and was\n",
      "particularly anxious that all the events of this, his first race meeting,\n",
      "should be started on time. \"Hurry up. Our race will be called in five\n",
      "minutes, and you've barely time to dress for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's my wheel?\" asked Snyder, glancing over the dozen or more machines\n",
      "stacked at one side of the room, but without seeing his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't seen it,\" answered Rod, \"but I supposed you had left it in some\n",
      "safe place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I did. I left it in the club house, where there would be no chance of\n",
      "anybody tampering with it; for I've heard of such things happening, but I\n",
      "ordered Dan to have it down here in time for the race.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to insinuate--\" began Rod hotly; but controlling himself, he\n",
      "continued more calmly, \"I didn't know that you had given Dan any orders,\n",
      "and I sent him over to the house on an errand a few minutes ago. Never\n",
      "mind, though, I'll go for your machine myself, and have it here by the\n",
      "time you are dressed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without waiting for a reply, the young captain started off on a run, while\n",
      "his adopted cousin began leisurely to undress, and get into his racing\n",
      "costume. By the time he was ready, Rod had returned leading the beautiful\n",
      "machine, which he had not ridden for fear lest some accident might happen\n",
      "to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the race was called, and a pistol shot sent the five young athletes\n",
      "bending low over their handle-bars spinning down the course. They all wore\n",
      "the club colors of scarlet and white; but from Rod's bicycle fluttered the\n",
      "bit of blue ribbon that Dan had been sent to the young captain's room to\n",
      "get, and which he had hastily knotted to the handle-bar of his machine\n",
      "just before starting. Eltje Vanderveer smiled and flushed slightly as she\n",
      "noticed it, and then all her attention was concentrated upon the varying\n",
      "fortunes of the flying wheelmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a five-mile race, and therefore a test of endurance rather than of\n",
      "strength or skill. There were two laps to the mile, and for seven of these\n",
      "Snyder Appleby held an easy lead. His name was heard above all others in\n",
      "the cheering that greeted each passing of the grand stand, though the\n",
      "others were encouraged to stick to him and not give it up yet. That two of\n",
      "them had no intention of giving it up, was shown at the end of the eighth\n",
      "lap, when the three leading wheels whirled past the grand stand so nearly\n",
      "abreast that no advantage could be claimed for either one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the cheering was tremendous; but the names of Rod Blake and Billy\n",
      "Bliss were tossed from mouth to mouth equally with that of Snyder Appleby.\n",
      "At the end of nine laps the champion of two years had fallen hopelessly\n",
      "behind. His face wore a distressed look, and his breath came in painful\n",
      "gasps. Cigarettes had done their work with him, and his wind was gone. The\n",
      "two leaders were still abreast; but Rod had obtained the inside position,\n",
      "and if he could keep up the pace the race was his.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eltje Vanderveer's face was pale, and her hands were clinched with the\n",
      "intense excitement of the moment. Was her champion to win after all? Was\n",
      "her bit of blue ribbon to be borne triumphantly to the front? Inch by inch\n",
      "it creeps into a lead. Now they are coming down the home stretch. The\n",
      "speed of that last spurt is wonderful. Nothing like it has ever been seen\n",
      "at the wind-up of a five-mile race on the Euston track. Looking at them,\n",
      "head on, it is for a few seconds hard to tell which is leading. Then a\n",
      "solitary shout for Rod Blake is heard. In another moment it has swelled\n",
      "into a perfect roar of cheering, and there is a tempest of tossing hats,\n",
      "handkerchiefs, and parasols.\n",

      "The attention of the spectators, including the club members, was so\n",
      "entirely given to the finish of the famous race for the Railroad Cup,\n",
      "that, for a few minutes Snyder Appleby was the sole occupant of the\n",
      "dressing-room. When a group of the fellows, forming a sort of triumphal\n",
      "escort to the victors, noisily entered it, they found him standing by his\n",
      "machine. It was supported by two rests placed under its handle bars, and\n",
      "he was gazing curiously at the big wheel, which he was slowly spinning\n",
      "with one hand.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, it turns as hard as though it were running on plain bearing that had\n",
      "never been oiled!\" exclaimed the member who had undertaken to turn the\n",
      "wheel as requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just it, and I don't think it's very surprising that I failed to\n",
      "win the race with a wheel in that condition, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I do not. The only surprising thing is that you held the lead so\n",
      "long as you did, and managed to come in third. I know I couldn't have run\n",
      "a single lap if I'd been on that wheel. What's the matter with it? Wasn't\n",
      "it all right when you started?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought it was,\" replied Snyder, \"but I soon found that something was\n",
      "wrong, and before I left the track it was all I could do to move it. Now,\n",
      "I want you fellows to find out what the matter is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A few moments of animated discussion followed, while several of the\n",
      "fellows made a careful examination of the bicycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Great Scott!\" exclaimed one; \"what's in this oil cup? It looks as though\n",
      "it were choked with black sand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's emery powder!\" cried another, extracting a few grains of the black,\n",
      "oil-soaked stuff on the point of a knife blade. \"No wonder your wheel\n",
      "won't turn. How on earth did it get there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what I would like to find out,\" answered the owner of the\n",
      "machine. \"It certainly was not there when I left the club house; for I had\n",
      "just gone over every part and assured myself that it was in perfect order.\n",
      "Since then but two persons have touched it, and I am one of them. I don't\n",
      "think it likely that anybody will charge me with having done this thing,\n",
      "seeing that my sole interest was to win the race, and that if I so nearly\n",
      "succeeded with my wheel in this condition, I could easily have done so had\n",
      "it been all right. Nothing could be more painful to me than to bring a\n",
      "charge against one who lives under the same roof that I do; but you all\n",
      "know who had the greatest interest in having me lose this race. I think\n",
      "you all know, too, that he is the only person besides myself who handled\n",
      "my wheel immediately before it. The one whom I trusted to bring it here in\n",
      "safety was sent off by this person on some frivolous errand at the last\n",
      "moment. Then, neglecting other and important duties, he volunteered to get\n",
      "the machine himself. He was gone before I had a chance to decline his\n",
      "offer. That is all I have to say upon this most unpleasant subject, and I\n",
      "should not have said so much had not my own reputation, both as a racing\n",
      "man and a gentleman, been at stake. Now I place the whole affair in the\n",

      "shoulders, and slowly recovering from the exhaustion of the race, had\n",
      "observed and listened to all this with a pained curiosity. He could not\n",
      "believe any member of the club guilty of such a cowardly act. When Snyder\n",
      "began to charge him with having committed it, his face became deadly pale,\n",
      "and he gazed at his adopted cousin with an expression akin to terror. As\n",
      "the latter finished, the young captain sprang to his feet, exclaiming:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Snyder Appleby, how dare you bring such an accusation against me? You\n",
      "know I am incapable of doing such a thing! Your wheel was in perfect\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I can easily believe that the fellow who would perform the act would be\n",

      "\"Do you mean that I lie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is about the size of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was more than the hot-tempered young athlete could bear; and almost\n",
      "before the words were out of Snyder's mouth, a blow delivered with all the\n",
      "nervous force of Rodman's right arm sent him staggering back. It would\n",
      "have laid him on the floor, had not several of the fellows caught him in\n",
      "their arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was furious with rage, and would have sprung at Rodman had he not been\n",
      "restrained. As it was, he hissed through his clinched teeth, \"I'll make\n",

      "\n",
      "Immediately after delivering the blow, Rod turned, without a word, and\n",
      "began putting on his clothes. The fellows watched him in silence. A minute\n",
      "later he was dressed, and stood in the doorway. Here he turned and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going home, fellows, and I shall wait there just one hour for an\n",
      "assurance that you have faith in me, and do not believe a word of this\n",
      "horrible charge. If such a message, sent by the whole club, reaches me\n",
      "within that time, I will undertake to prove my innocence. If it does not\n",

      "bewildered fashion, when a message was sent in. It was that President\n",
      "Vanderveer, who was distributing the prizes for the several races out in\n",
      "front of the grand stand, was ready to present the Railroad Cup to Rodman\n",
      "Blake, and wanted him to come and receive it. Then somebody went out and\n",
      "whispered to the President. Excusing himself for a moment to the throng of\n",
      "spectators, he visited the dressing-room, where he heard the whole story.\n",
      "It was hurriedly told; but he comprehended enough of it to know that the\n",
      "cup could not, at that moment, be presented to anybody. So he went back,\n",
      "and with a very sober face, told the people that owing to circumstances\n",
      "which he was not at liberty to explain just then, it was impossible to\n",
      "award the Railroad Cup at that meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd slowly melted away; but before they left, everybody had heard\n",
      "one version or another of the story told to President Vanderveer in the\n",
      "dressing-room. Some believed Rod to be innocent of the charge brought\n",
      "against him, and some believed him guilty. Almost all of them said it was\n",
      "a pity that such races could not be won and lost honestly, and there must\n",
      "be some fire where there was so much smoke; and they told each other how\n",
      "they had noticed from the very first that something was wrong with Snyder\n",
      "Appleby's wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major Appleby heard the story, first from President Vanderveer, and\n",
      "afterwards from his adopted son, who confirmed it by displaying the side\n",
      "of his face which was swollen and bruised from Rodman's blow. Fully\n",
      "believing what Snyder told him, the Major became very angry. He declared\n",
      "that no such disgrace had ever before been brought to his house, and that\n",
      "the boy who was the cause of it could no longer be sheltered by his roof.\n",
      "In vain did people talk to him, and urge him to reflect before he acted.\n",
      "He had decided upon his course, and the more they advised him, the more\n",
      "determined he became not to be moved from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was thus storming and fuming outside the dressing-room, the\n",
      "members of the wheel club were holding a meeting behind its closed door.\n",
      "Did they believe Rodman Blake guilty of the act charged against him or did\n",
      "they not? The debate was a long and exciting one; but the question was\n",
      "finally decided in his favor. They did not believe him capable of doing\n",
      "anything so mean. They would make a thorough investigation of the affair,\n",
      "and aid him by every means in their power to prove his innocence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the purport of the message sent to the young captain by the club\n",
      "secretary, Billy Bliss; but it was sent too late. The members had taken no\n",
      "note of time in the heat of their discussion, and the hour named by Rodman\n",
      "had already elapsed before Billy Bliss started on his errand. The fellows\n",
      "did not think a few minutes more or less would make any difference, though\n",
      "they urged the secretary to hurry and deliver his message as quickly as\n",
      "possible. A few minutes however did make all the difference in the world\n",
      "to Rod Blake. With him an hour meant exactly sixty minutes; and when\n",
      "Billy Bliss reached Major Appleby's house the boy whom he sought was\n",
      "nowhere to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major Appleby and his adopted son walked home together, the former full of\n",
      "wrath at what he believed to be the disgraceful action of his nephew, and\n",
      "the latter secretly rejoicing at it. On reaching the house, the Major went\n",
      "at once to Rodman's room where he found the boy gazing from the window,\n",
      "with a hard, defiant, expression on his face. He was longing for a single\n",
      "loving word; for a mother's sympathetic ear into which he might pour his\n",
      "griefs; but his pride was prepared to withstand any harshness, as well as\n",
      "to resent the faintest suspicion of injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" began the Major, \"what have you to say for yourself? and how\n",
      "do you explain this disgraceful affair?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot explain it, Uncle; but----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will do, sir. If you cannot explain it, I want to hear nothing\n",
      "further. What I do want, however, is that you shall so arrange your future\n",
      "plans that you may no longer be dependent on my roof for shelter. Here is\n",
      "sufficient money for your immediate needs. As my sister's child you have\n",
      "a certain claim on me. This I shall be willing to honor to the extent of\n",
      "providing you against want, whenever you have settled upon your mode of\n",
      "life, and choose to favor me with your future address. The sooner you can\n",
      "decide upon your course of action the better.\" Thus saying the\n",
      "kind-hearted, impetuous, and wrong-headed old Major laid a roll of bills\n",
      "on the table, and left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteen minutes later, or five minutes before Billy Bliss reached the\n",

      "travelling bag, containing the pictures of his parents, a change of\n",
      "underclothing, and a few trifles that were absolutely his own. He passed\n",
      "out of the house by a side door, and was seen but by one person as he\n",
      "plunged into the twilight shadows of the park. Thus, through the gathering\n",
      "darkness, the poor boy, proud, high-spirited, and, as he thought,\n",

      "As Rod Blake, heavy-hearted, and weary, both mentally and physically from\n",
      "his recent struggles, left his uncle's house, he felt utterly reckless,\n",
      "and paid no heed to the direction his footsteps were taking. His one idea\n",
      "was to get away as quickly, and as far as possible, from those who had\n",
      "treated him so cruelly. \"If only the fellows had stood by me,\" he thought,\n",
      "\"I might have stayed and fought it out. But to have them go back on me,\n",
      "and take Snyder's word in preference to mine, is too much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the poor boy but known that Billy Bliss was even then hastening to\n",
      "bear a message of good-will and confidence in him from the \"fellows\" how\n",
      "greatly his burden of trial would have been lightened. But he did not\n",
      "know, and so he pushed blindly on, suffering as much from his own hasty\n",
      "and ill-considered course of action, as from the more deliberate cruelty\n",
      "of his adopted cousin. At length he came to the brow of a steep slope\n",
      "leading down to the railroad, the very one of which Eltje's father was\n",
      "president. The railroad had always possessed a fascination for him, and he\n",
      "had often sat on this bank watching the passing trains, wondering at their\n",
      "speed, and speculating as to their destinations. He had frequently thought\n",
      "he should like to lead the life of a railroad man, and had been pleased\n",
      "when the fellows called him \"Railroad Blake\" on account of his initials.\n",

      "in the cab, with one hand on the throttle lever, and peering steadily\n",
      "ahead through the gathering gloom. What a glorious life he led! So full of\n",
      "excitement and constant change. What a power he controlled. How easy it\n",
      "was for him to fly from whatever was unpleasant or trying. As these\n",
      "thoughts flashed through the boy's mind, the red lights at the rear of the\n",
      "train seemed to blink pleasantly at him, and invite him to follow them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will,\" he cried, springing to his feet. \"I will follow wherever they\n",
      "may lead me. Why should I not be a railroad man as well as another? They\n",
      "have all been boys and all had to begin some time.\"\n",

      "a-spying on you, Mister Rod, and I only followed you to tell you supper\n",
      "was ready, 'cause I thought maybe you didn't know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I didn't and it makes no difference whether I did or not,\" said\n",

      "more suppers in it for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was afeard so! I was afeard so, Mister Rod,\" exclaimed the boy with a\n",
      "real distress in his voice, \"an' to tell the truth that's why I came after\n",
      "you. I couldn't a-bear to have you go without saying good-by, and I\n",
      "thought maybe, perhaps, you'd let me go along with you. Please do, Mister\n",

      "\"You leaves a-plenty of them--a-plenty!\" interrupted the stable boy\n",

      "cruel not to give you the cup, an' that you couldn't do a thing, such as\n",
      "they said, any more than she could, or he could himself. An' her father\n",
      "said no more did he believe you could, an' you'd come out of it all right\n",
      "yet. Miss Eltje was right up an' down mad about it, she was. Oh, I tell\n",
      "you, Mister Rod, you've got a-plenty of friends; an' if you'll only stay\n",
      "you'll find 'em jest a-swarmin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this Rodman laughed outright, and said: \"Dan, you are a fine fellow,\n",
      "and you have done me good already. Now what I want you to do is just to\n",
      "stay here and discover some more friends for me. I will manage to let you\n",
      "know what I am doing; but you must not tell anybody a word about me, nor\n",
      "where I am, nor anything. Now good-by, and mind, don't say a word about\n",

      "you might say that I shall always remember her, and be grateful to her for\n",
      "believing in me. Good-by.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With this Rod plunged down the steep bank to the railroad track, and\n",
      "disappeared in the darkness. He went in the direction of the next station\n",
      "to Euston, about five miles away, as he did not wish to be recognized when\n",
      "he made the attempt to secure a ride on some train to New York. It was to\n",
      "be an attempt only; for he had not a cent of money in his pockets, and had\n",
      "no idea of how he should obtain the coveted ride. In addition to being\n",
      "penniless, he was hungry, and his hunger was increased tenfold by the\n",
      "knowledge that he had no means of satisfying it. Still he was a boy with\n",
      "unlimited confidence in himself. He always had fallen on his feet; and,\n",
      "though this was the worse fix in which he had ever found himself, he had\n",
      "faith that he would come out of it all right somehow. His heart was\n",
      "already so much lighter since he had learned from Dan that some of his\n",
      "friends, and especially Eltje Vanderveer, still believed in him, that his\n",
      "situation did not seem half so desperate as it had an hour before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod was already enough of a railroad man to know that, as he was going\n",
      "east, he must walk on the west bound track. By so doing he would be able\n",
      "to see trains bound west, while they were still at some distance from him,\n",
      "and would be in no danger from those bound east and overtaking him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was about half a mile from the little station, toward which he was\n",
      "walking, he heard the long-drawn, far-away whistle of a locomotive. Was it\n",
      "ahead of him or behind? On account of the bewildering echoes he could not\n",
      "tell. To settle the question he kneeled down, and placed his ear against\n",
      "one of rails of the west bound track. It was cold and silent. Then he\n",
      "tried the east bound track in the same way. This rail seemed to tingle\n",
      "with life, and a faint, humming sound came from it. It was a perfect\n",
      "railroad telephone, and it informed the listener as plainly as words could\n",
      "have told him, that a train was approaching from the west.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped to note its approach. In a few minutes the rails of the east\n",
      "bound track began to quiver with light from the powerful reflector in\n",
      "front of its locomotive. Then they stretched away toward the oncoming\n",
      "train in gleaming bands of indefinite length, while the dazzling light\n",
      "seemed to cut a bright pathway between walls of solid blackness for the\n",
      "use of the advancing monster. As the bewildering glare passed him, Rod saw\n",
      "that the train was a long, heavy-laden freight, and that some of its cars\n",
      "contained cattle. He stood motionless as it rushed past him, shaking the\n",
      "solid earth with its ponderous weight, and he drew a decided breath of\n",
      "relief at the sight of the blinking red eyes on the rear platform of its\n",
      "caboose. How he wished he was in that caboose, riding comfortably toward\n",
      "New York, instead of plodding wearily along on foot, with nothing but\n",

      "\n",
      "As Rod stood gazing at the receding train he noticed a human figure step\n",
      "from the lighted interior of the caboose, through the open doorway, to the\n",
      "platform, apparently kick at something, and almost instantly return into\n",
      "the car. At the same time the boy fancied he heard a sharp cry of pain;\n",
      "but was not sure. As he resumed his tiresome walk, gazing longingly after\n",
      "the vanishing train lights, he saw another light, a white one that moved\n",
      "toward him with a swinging motion, close to the ground. While he was\n",
      "wondering what it was, he almost stumbled over a small animal that stood\n",
      "motionless on the track, directly in front of him. It was a dog. Now Rod\n",
      "dearly loved dogs, and seemed instinctively to know that this one was in\n",
      "some sort of trouble. As he stopped to pat it, the creature uttered a\n",
      "little whine, as though asking his sympathy and help. At the same time it\n",
      "licked his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was kneeling beside the dog and trying to discover what its\n",
      "trouble was, the swinging white light approached so closely that he saw\n",
      "it to be a lantern, borne by a man who, in his other hand, carried a\n",
      "long-handled iron wrench. He was the track-walker of that section, who\n",
      "was obliged to inspect every foot of the eight miles of track under his\n",
      "charge, at least twice a day; and the wrench was for the tightening of\n",
      "any loose rail joints that he might discover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello!\" exclaimed this individual as he came before the little group,\n",
      "and held his lantern so as to get a good view of them. \"What's the matter\n",
      "here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have just found this dog,\" replied Rod, \"and he seems to be in pain. If\n",
      "you will please hold your light a little closer perhaps I can see what has\n",
      "happened to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man did as requested, and Rod uttered an exclamation of pleasure as\n",
      "the light fell full upon the dog; for it was the finest specimen of a bull\n",
      "terrier he had ever seen. It was white and brindled, its chest was of\n",
      "unusual breadth, and its square jaws indicated a tenacity of purpose that\n",
      "nothing short of death itself could overcome. Now one of its legs was\n",
      "evidently hurt, and it had an ugly cut under the left ear, from which\n",
      "blood was flowing. Its eyes expressed an almost human intelligence; and,\n",
      "as it looked up at Rod and tried to lick his face, it seemed to say, \"I\n",
      "know you will be my friend, and I trust you to help me.\" About its neck\n",
      "was a leathern collar, bearing a silver plate, on which was inscribed:\n",
      "\"Be kind to me, for I am Smiler the Railroad Dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know this dog,\" exclaimed the track-walker, as he read these words,\n",
      "\"and I reckon every railroad man in the country knows him; or at any rate\n",
      "has heard of him. He used to belong to Andrew Dean, who was killed when\n",
      "his engine went over the bank at Hager's two years ago. He thought the\n",
      "world of the dog, and it used to travel with him most always; only once in\n",
      "a while it would go visiting on some of the other engines. It was off that\n",
      "way when Andrew got killed, and since then it has travelled all over the\n",
      "country, like as though it was hunting for its old master. The dog lives\n",
      "on trains and engines, and railroad men are always glad to see him. Some\n",
      "of them got up this collar for him a while ago. Why, Smiler, old dog, how\n",
      "did you come here in this fix? I never heard of you getting left or\n",
      "falling off a train before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think he must have come from the freight that just passed us,\" said\n",

      "movements of the figure he had seen appear for an instant at the caboose\n",
      "door, \"if he was kicked off.\" Then he described the scene of which he had\n",
      "caught a glimpse as the freight train passed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd like to meet the man who'd dare do such a thing,\" exclaimed the\n",
      "track-walker. \"If I wouldn't kick him! He'd dance to a lively tune if any\n",
      "of us railroad chaps got hold of him, I can tell you. It must have been an\n",
      "accident, though; for nobody would hurt Smiler. Now I don't know exactly\n",
      "what to do. Smiler can't be left here, and I'm afraid he isn't able to\n",
      "walk very far. If I had time I'd carry him back to the freight. She's\n",
      "side-tracked only a quarter of a mile from here, waiting for Number 8 to\n",
      "pass. I'm due at Euston inside of an hour, and I don't dare waste any more\n",
      "time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll take him if you say so,\" answered Rod, who had been greatly\n",
      "interested in the dog's history. \"I believe I can carry him that far.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" replied the track-walker. \"I wish you would. You'll have to\n",
      "move lively though; for if Number 8 is on time, as she generally is, you\n",
      "haven't a moment to lose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do my best,\" said the boy, and a moment later he was hurrying down\n",
      "the track with his M. I. P. bag strapped to his shoulders, and with the\n",
      "dog so strangely committed to his care, clasped tightly in his arms. At\n",
      "the same time the track-walker, with his swinging lantern, was making\n",
      "equally good speed in the opposite direction. As Rod rounded a curve, and\n",
      "sighted the lights of the waiting freight train, he heard the warning\n",
      "whistle of Number 8 behind him, and redoubled his exertions. He did not\n",
      "stop even as the fast express whirled past him, though he was nearly\n",
      "blinded by the eddying cloud of dust and cinders that trailed behind it.\n",
      "But, if Number 8 was on time, so was he. Though Smiler had grown heavy\n",
      "as lead in his aching arms, and though his breath was coming in panting\n",
      "gasps, he managed to climb on the rear platform of the caboose, just as\n",
      "the freight was pulling out. How glad he was at that moment of the three\n",
      "weeks training he had just gone through with. It had won him something,\n",
      "even if his name was not to be engraved on the railroad cup of the Steel\n",
      "Wheel Club.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boy stood in the rear doorway of the caboose, gazing doubtfully\n",
      "into its interior, a young fellow who looked like a tramp, and who had\n",
      "been lying on one of the cushioned lockers, or benches, that ran along the\n",
      "sides of the car, sprang to his feet with a startled exclamation. At the\n",
      "same moment Smiler drew back his upper lip so as to display a glistening\n",
      "row of teeth, and, uttering a deep growl, tried to escape from Rod's arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing in this car! and what do you mean by bringing that dog\n",
      "in here?\" cried the fellow angrily, at the same time advancing with a\n",
      "threatening gesture. \"Come, clear out of here or I'll put you out,\" he\n",
      "added. The better to defend himself, if he should be attacked, the boy\n",
      "dropped the dog; and, with another fierce growl, forgetful of his hurts,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Help! Murder! Take off your dog!\" yelled the young tramp, throwing up his\n",
      "arm to protect his face from Smiler's attack, and springing backward. In\n",
      "so doing he tripped and fell heavily to the floor, with the dog on top of\n",
      "him, growling savagely, and tearing at the ragged coat-sleeve in which his\n",
      "teeth were fastened. Fearful lest the dog might inflict some serious\n",
      "injury upon the fellow, Rodman rushed to his assistance. He had just\n",
      "seized hold of Smiler, when a kick from the struggling tramp sent his feet\n",
      "flying from under him, and he too pitched headlong. There ensued a scene\n",
      "which would have been comical enough to a spectator, but which was\n",
      "anything but funny to those who took part in it. Over and over they\n",
      "rolled, striking, biting, kicking, and struggling. The tramp was the first\n",
      "to regain his feet; but almost at the same instant Smiler escaped from\n",
      "Rod's embrace, and again flew at him. They had rolled over the caboose\n",
      "floor until they were close to its rear door; and now, with a yell of\n",
      "terror, the tramp darted through it, sprang from the moving train, and\n",
      "disappeared in the darkness, leaving a large piece of his trousers in the\n",
      "dog's mouth. Just then the forward door was opened, and two men with\n",
      "lanterns on their arms, entered the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were Conductor Tobin, and rear-brakeman Joe, his right-hand man,\n",
      "who had just finished switching their train back on the main track, and\n",
      "getting it again started on its way toward New York. At the sight of Rod,\n",
      "who was of course a perfect stranger to them, sitting on the floor,\n",
      "hatless, covered with dust, his clothing bearing many signs of the recent\n",
      "fray, and ruefully feeling of a lump on his forehead that was rapidly\n",
      "increasing in size, and of Smiler whose head was bloody, and who was still\n",
      "worrying the last fragment of clothing that the tramp's rags had yielded\n",
      "him, they stood for a moment in silent bewilderment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll be blowed!\" said Conductor Tobin at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me too,\" said Brakeman Joe, who believed in following the lead of his\n",
      "superior officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I inquire,\" asked Conductor Tobin, seating himself on a locker close\n",
      "to where Rod still sat on the floor, \"May I inquire who you are? and where\n",
      "you came from? and how you got here? and what's happened to Smiler? and\n",
      "what's came of the fellow we left sleeping here a few minutes ago? and\n",
      "what's the meaning of all this business, anyway?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we'd like to know,\" said the Brakeman, taking a seat on the opposite\n",
      "locker, and regarding the boy with a curiosity that was not unmixed with\n",
      "suspicion. Owing to extensive dealings with tramps, Brakeman Joe was very\n",
      "apt to be suspicious of all persons who were dirty, and ragged, and had\n",
      "bumps on their foreheads.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The trouble is,\" replied Rod, looking first at Conductor Tobin and then\n",
      "at Brakeman Joe, \"that I don't know all about it myself. Nobody does\n",
      "except the fellow who just left here in such a hurry, and Smiler, who\n",
      "can't tell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the dog, hearing his name mentioned, dragged himself rather stiffly\n",
      "to the boy's side; for now that the excitement was over, his hurts\n",
      "began to be painful again, and licked his face.\n",

      "[Illustration: SMILER DRIVES OFF THE TRAMP.--(_Page 41._)]\n",

      "\"Well, you must be one of the right sort, at any rate,\" said Conductor\n",
      "Tobin, noting this movement, \"for Smiler is a dog that doesn't make\n",
      "friends except with them as are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He knows what's what, and who's who,\" added Brakeman Joe, nodding his\n",
      "head. \"Don't you, Smiler, old dog?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name,\" continued the boy, \"is R. R. Blake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Railroad Blake?\" interrupted Conductor Tobin inquiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or 'Runaway Blake'?\" asked Brakeman Joe who, still somewhat suspicious,\n",
      "was studying the boy's face and the M. I. P. bag attached to his\n",
      "shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both,\" answered Rod, with a smile. \"The boys where I live, or rather\n",
      "where I did live, often call me 'Railroad Blake,' and I am a runaway. That\n",
      "is, I was turned away first, and ran away afterwards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as briefly as possible, he gave them the whole history of his\n",
      "adventures, beginning with the bicycle race, and ending with the\n",
      "disappearance of the young tramp through the rear door of the caboose in\n",
      "which they sat. Both men listened with the deepest attention, and without\n",
      "interrupting him save by occasional ejaculations, expressive of wonder and\n",
      "sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll be blowed!\" exclaimed Conductor Tobin, when he had finished;\n",
      "while Brakeman Joe, without a word, went to the rear door and examined the\n",
      "platform, with the hope, as he afterwards explained, of finding there the\n",
      "fellow who had kicked Smiler off the train, and of having a chance to\n",
      "serve him in the same way. Coming back with a disappointed air, he\n",
      "proceeded to light a fire in the little round caboose stove, and prepare a\n",
      "pot of coffee for supper, leaving Rodman's case to be managed by Conductor\n",
      "Tobin as he thought best.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter told the boy that the young tramp, as they called him, was\n",
      "billed through to New York, to look after some cattle that were on the\n",
      "train; but that he was a worthless, ugly fellow, who had not paid the\n",
      "slightest attention to them, and whose only object in accepting the job\n",
      "was evidently to obtain a free ride in the caboose. Smiler, whom he had\n",
      "been delighted to find on the train when it was turned over to him, had\n",
      "taken a great dislike to the fellow from the first. He had growled and\n",
      "shown his teeth whenever the tramp moved about the car, and several times\n",
      "the latter had threatened to teach him better manners. When he and\n",
      "Brakeman Joe went to the forward end of the train, to make ready for\n",
      "side-tracking it, they left the dog sitting on the rear platform of the\n",
      "caboose, and the tramp apparently asleep, as Rod had found him, on one of\n",
      "the lockers. He must have taken advantage of their absence to deal the dog\n",
      "the cruel kick that cut his ear, and landed him, stunned and bruised, on\n",
      "the track where he had been discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad he's gone,\" concluded Conductor Tobin, \"for if he hadn't left,\n",
      "we would have fired him for what he did to Smiler. We won't have that dog\n",
      "hurt on this road, not if we know it. It won't hurt him to have to walk\n",
      "to New York, and I don't care if he never gets there. What worries me,\n",
      "though, is who'll look after those cattle, and go down to the stock-yard\n",
      "with them, now that he's gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why couldn't I do it?\" asked Rod eagerly. \"I'd be glad to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You!\" said Conductor Tobin incredulously. \"Why, you look like too much\n",
      "of a gentleman to be handling cattle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I am a gentleman,\" answered the boy with a smile; \"but I am a very\n",
      "poverty-stricken one just at present, and if I can earn a ride to the\n",
      "city, just by looking after some cattle, I don't know why I shouldn't do\n",
      "that as well as anything else. What I would like to do though, most of all\n",
      "things, is to live up to my nickname, and become a railroad man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would, would you?\" said Conductor Tobin. Then, as though he were\n",
      "propounding a conundrum, he asked: \"Do you know the difference between\n",
      "a railroad man and a chap who wants to be one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know that I do,\" answered the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the difference is, that the latter gets what he deserves, and the\n",
      "former deserves what he gets. What I mean is, that almost anybody who is\n",
      "willing to take whatever job is offered him can get a position on a\n",
      "railroad; but before he gets promoted he will have to deserve it several\n",
      "times over. In other words, it takes more honesty, steadiness,\n",
      "faithfulness, hard work, and brains to work your way up in railroad life\n",
      "than in any other business that I know of. However, at present, you are\n",
      "only going along with me as stockman, in which position I am glad to have\n",
      "you, so we won't stop now to discuss railroading. Let's see what Joe has\n",
      "got for supper, for I'm hungry and I shouldn't be surprised if you were.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed Rod was hungry, and just at that moment the word supper was the\n",
      "most welcome of the whole English language. First, though, he went to the\n",
      "wash-basin that he noticed at the forward end of the car. There he bathed\n",
      "his face and hands, brushed his hair, restored his clothing to something\n",
      "like order, and altogether made himself so presentable, that Conductor\n",
      "Tobin laughed when he saw him, and declared that he looked less like a\n",
      "stockman than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "How good that supper, taken from the mammoth lunch pails of the train\n",
      "crew, tasted, and what delicious coffee came steaming out of the\n",
      "smoke-blackened pot that Brakeman Joe lifted so carefully from the stove!\n",
      "To be sure it had to be taken without milk, but there was plenty of sugar,\n",
      "and when Rod passed his tin cup for a second helping, the coffee maker's\n",

      "\n",
      "After these three and Smiler had finished their supper, Conductor Tobin\n",
      "lighted his pipe, and, climbing up into the cupola of the caboose,\n",
      "stretched himself comfortably on the cushioned seat arranged there for his\n",
      "especial accommodation. From here, through the windows ahead, behind, and\n",
      "on both sides of the cupola, he had an unobstructed view out into the\n",
      "night. Brakeman Joe went out over the tops of the cars to call in the\n",
      "other two brakeman of the train, and keep watch for them, while they went\n",
      "into the caboose and ate their supper. They looked curiously at Rod as\n",
      "they entered the car; but were too well used to seeing strangers riding\n",
      "there to ask any questions. They both spoke to Smiler though, and he\n",
      "wagged his tail as though recognizing old friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog could not go to them and jump up to be petted because Rod was\n",
      "attending to his wounds. He carefully bathed the cut under the left ear,\n",
      "from which considerable blood had flowed, and drew its edges together with\n",
      "some sticking plaster, of which he always carried a small quantity in his\n",
      "M. I. P. bag. Then, finding one of the dog's fore shoulders strained and\n",
      "swollen, he soaked it for some time in water as hot as the animal could\n",
      "bear. After arranging a comfortable bed in one corner of the car, he\n",
      "finally persuaded Smiler to lie there quietly, though not until he had\n",
      "submitted to a grateful licking of his face and hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next the boy turned his attention to the supper dishes, and had them very\n",
      "nearly washed and wiped when Brakeman Joe returned, greatly to that\n",
      "stalwart fellow's surprise and delight; for Joe hated to wash dishes.\n",
      "By this time Rod had been nearly two hours on the train, and was so\n",
      "thoroughly tired that he concluded to lie down and rest until he should be\n",
      "wanted for something else. He did not mean to even close his eyes, but\n",
      "within three minutes he was fast asleep. All through the night he slept,\n",
      "while the long freight train, stopping only now and then for water, or to\n",
      "allow some faster train to pass it, rumbled heavily along toward the great\n",
      "city.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not at first realize where he was, when, in the gray of the next\n",
      "morning, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and Conductor Tobin's voice\n",
      "said: \"Come, my young stockman, here we are at the end of our run, and it\n",
      "is time for you to be looking after your cattle.\" A quick dash of cold\n",
      "water on his head and face cleared the boy's faculties in an instant.\n",
      "Then Conductor Tobin pointed out the two stock cars full of cattle that\n",
      "were being uncoupled from the rest of the train, and bade him go with them\n",
      "to the stock-yard. There he was to see that the cattle were well watered\n",
      "and safely secured in the pen that would be assigned to them. Rod was also\n",
      "told that he might leave his bag in the caboose and come back, after he\n",
      "was through with his work, for a bit of breakfast with Brakeman Joe, who\n",
      "lived at the other end of the division, and always made the car his home\n",
      "when at this end. As for himself, Conductor Tobin said he must bid the boy\n",
      "good-by, as he lived a short distance out on the road, and must hurry to\n",
      "catch the train that would take him home. He would be back, ready to start\n",
      "out again with the through freight, that evening, and hoped Rod would come\n",
      "and tell him what luck he had in obtaining a position. Then rough but\n",
      "kind-hearted Conductor Tobin left the boy, never for a moment imagining\n",
      "that he was absolutely penniless and without friends in that part of the\n",
      "country, or in the great city across the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next two hours Rod worked hard and faithfully with the cattle\n",
      "committed to his charge, and then, anticipating with a keen appetite a\n",
      "share of Brakeman Joe's breakfast, he returned to where he had left the\n",
      "caboose. It was not there, nor could he find a trace of it. He saw plenty\n",
      "of other cabooses looking just like it, but none of them was the one he\n",
      "wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "He inquired of a busy switch-tender where it could be found, and the man\n",
      "asked him its number. He had not noticed. What was the number of the train\n",
      "with which it came in? Rod had no idea. The number of the locomotive that\n",
      "drew it then? The boy did not know that either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the man impatiently, \"you don't seem to know much of\n",

      "before you bother busy folks with questions.\"\n",

      "treasures contained in his M. I. P. bag, and never had life seemed darker\n",

      "on a railroad everything goes by numbers instead of by names. A few years\n",
      "ago all locomotives bore names, such as \"Flying Cloud,\" \"North Wind,\"\n",
      "etc., or were called after prominent men; but now they are simply\n",
      "numbered. It is the same with cars, except sleepers, drawing-rooms, and a\n",
      "few mail cars. Trains are also numbered, odd numbers being given to west\n",
      "or south bound, and even numbers to east or north bound trains. Thus,\n",
      "while a passenger says he is going out by the Chicago Limited, the Pacific\n",
      "Express, or the Fitchburg Local, the railroad man would say that he was\n",
      "going on No. 1, 3, or 5, as the case might be. The sections, from three to\n",
      "eight miles long, into which every road is divided, are numbered, as are\n",
      "all its bridges. Even the stations are numbered, and so are the tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this Rodman discovered afterwards; but he did not know it then, and so\n",

      "decided to follow out his original plan of going to the superintendent's\n",
      "office and asking for employment. By inquiry he found that it was located\n",
      "over the passenger station, nearly a mile away from where he stood. When\n",
      "he reached the station, and inquired for the person of whom he was in\n",
      "search, he was laughed at, and told that the \"super\" never came to his\n",
      "office at that time of day, nor until two or three hours later. So,\n",
      "feeling faint for want of breakfast, as well as tired and somewhat\n",

      "At one side of the room was a lunch-counter, from which the odor of\n",

      "thinking of such things; and so he resolutely turned his back upon\n",
      "the steaming urn, and the tempting pile of eatables by which it was\n",
      "surrounded. In watching the endless streams of passengers steadily ebbing\n",
      "and flowing past him, he almost forgot the emptiness of his stomach. Where\n",
      "could they all be going to, or coming from? Did people always travel in\n",
      "such overwhelming numbers, that it seemed as though the whole world were\n",
      "on the move, or was this some special occasion? He thought the latter must\n",
      "be the case, and wondered what the occasion was. Then there were the\n",
      "babies and children! How they swarmed about him! He soon found that he\n",
      "could keep pretty busy, and win many a grateful smile from anxious\n",
      "mothers, by capturing and picking up little toddlers who would persist in\n",
      "running about and falling down right in the way of hurrying passengers.\n",
      "He also kept an eye on the old ladies, who were so flustered and\n",
      "bewildered, and asked such meaningless questions of everybody, that he\n",
      "wondered how they were ever to reach their destinations in safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these deposited a perfect avalanche of little bags, packages, and\n",
      "umbrellas on the seat beside him. Several of them fell to the floor, and\n",
      "Rod was good-naturedly picking them up when he was startled by the sound\n",
      "of a clear, girlish voice that he knew as well as he knew his own,\n",
      "directly behind him. He turned, with a quickly beating heart, and saw\n",
      "Eltje Vanderveer. She was walking between her father and Snyder Appleby.\n",
      "They had already passed without seeing him, and had evidently just arrived\n",
      "by an early morning train from Euston.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod's first impulse was to run after them; and, starting to do so, he was\n",
      "only a step behind them when he heard Snyder say: \"He must have money,\n",
      "because he refused a hundred dollars that the Major offered him. At any\n",
      "rate we'll hear from him soon enough if he gets hard up or into trouble.\n",
      "He isn't the kind of a----\"\n",

      "But Rod had already turned away, and what he wasn't, in Snyder's opinion,\n",
      "he never knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had hardly resumed his seat, when there was a merry jingle on the\n",
      "floor beside him, and a quantity of silver coins began to roll in all\n",
      "directions. The nervous old lady of the bags and bundles had dropped her\n",
      "purse, and now she stood gazing at her scattered wealth, the very image\n",
      "of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, ma'am,\" said Rod, cheerily, as he began to capture the truant\n",
      "coins. \"I'll have them all picked up in a moment.\" It took several minutes\n",
      "of searching here and there, under the seats, and in all sorts of\n",
      "out-of-the-way hiding places, before all the bits of silver were\n",
      "recovered, and handed to their owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew a great sigh of relief as she counted her money and found that\n",
      "none was lost. Then, beaming at the boy through her spectacles, she said:\n",
      "\"Well, thee is an honest lad; and, if thee'll look after my bags while I\n",
      "get my ticket, and then help me to the train, I'll give thee a quarter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod was on the point of saying, politely: \"I shall be most happy to do\n",
      "anything I can for you, ma'am; but I couldn't think of accepting pay for\n",
      "it,\" when the thought of his position flashed over him. A quarter would\n",
      "buy him a breakfast, and it would be honorably earned too. Would it not be\n",
      "absolutely wrong to refuse it under the circumstances? Thus thinking, he\n",
      "touched his cap, and said: \"Certainly I will do all I can to help you,\n",
      "ma'am, and will be glad of the chance to earn a quarter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the old lady had procured her ticket, and Rod had received the\n",
      "first bit of money he had ever earned in his life by helping her to a\n",
      "comfortable seat in the right car, she would have detained and questioned\n",
      "him, but for her fear that he might be carried off. So she bade him hurry\n",
      "from the car as quickly as possible, though it still lacked nearly ten\n",
      "minutes of the time of starting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hungry boy knew well enough where he wanted to go, and what he wanted\n",
      "to do, now. In about three seconds after leaving the car he was seated at\n",
      "the railroad lunch-counter, with a cup of coffee, two hard-boiled eggs,\n",
      "and a big hot roll before him. He could easily have disposed of twice as\n",
      "much; but prudently determined to save some of his money for another meal,\n",
      "which he realized, with a sigh, would be demanded by his vigorous appetite\n",
      "before the day was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his dismay, when he asked the young woman behind the counter how much\n",
      "he owed for what he had eaten, she answered, \"Twenty-five cents, please.\"\n",
      "He thought there must be some mistake, and asked her if there was not; but\n",
      "she answered: \"Not at all. Ten cents for coffee, ten for eggs, and five\n",
      "for the roll.\" With this she swept Rod's solitary quarter into the\n",
      "money-drawer, and turned to wait on another customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it costs something to live,\" thought the boy, ruefully, as he\n",
      "walked away from the counter. \"At that rate I could easily have eaten a\n",
      "dollar's worth of breakfast, and I certainly sha'n't choose this for my\n",

      "appeared to drag along so wearily. When not thus engaged he haunted the\n",
      "freight yard, mounting the steps of every caboose he saw, in the hope of\n",
      "recognizing it. At length, to his great joy, shortly before five o'clock\n",
      "he saw, through a window set in the door of one of these, the\n",
      "well-remembered interior in which he had spent the preceding night. He\n",
      "could not be mistaken, for there lay his own M. I. P. bag on one of the\n",

      "\"Better wait till you hear what it is, and we see if we can get it,\"\n",
      "interrupted Joe. \"You see the way of it is this, there was a gent around\n",
      "here awhile ago with a horse, that he wants to send out on our train, to\n",
      "some place in the western part of the State. I don't know just where it's\n",
      "going, but his brother is to meet it at the end of our run, and take\n",

      "paying the extravagant prices charged at railroad lunch-counters, Rod took\n",
      "his place, with Juniper, in car number 1160, which was the one assigned to\n",
      "them. Here he proceeded to make the acquaintance of his charge; and, aided\n",
      "by a few lumps of sugar that he had obtained for this purpose, he soon\n",
      "succeeded in establishing the most friendly relations between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, while he was patting and talking to the horse, car number 1160\n",
      "received a heavy bump from a string of empties, that had just been sent\n",
      "flying down the track on which it stood, by a switch engine. Juniper was\n",
      "very nearly flung off his feet, and was greatly frightened. Before Rod\n",
      "could quiet him, there came another bump from the opposite direction,\n",
      "followed by a jerk. Then the car began to move, while Juniper, quivering\n",
      "in every limb, snorted with terror. Now came a period of \"drilling,\" as it\n",
      "is called, that proved anything but pleasant either to the boy or to the\n",
      "frightened animal. The car was pushed and pulled from one track to\n",
      "another, sometimes alone and sometimes in company with other cars. The\n",
      "train of which it was to form a part was being made up, and the \"drilling\"\n",
      "was for the purpose of getting together the several cars bound to certain\n",
      "places, and of placing those that were to be dropped off first, behind\n",
      "those that were to make the longest runs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Juniper's fears increased with each moment, until at length, when a\n",
      "passenger locomotive, with shrieking whistle, rushed past within a few\n",
      "feet, he gave a jump that broke the rope halter confining him, and bounded\n",
      "to the extreme end of the car. Rod sprang to the open door--not with any\n",
      "idea of leaving the car, oh, no! his sense of duty was too strong for\n",
      "that, but for the purpose of closing it so that the horse should not leap\n",
      "out. Then he approached the terrified animal with soothing words, and\n",
      "caught hold of the broken halter. At the same moment the car was again set\n",
      "in motion, and the horse, now wild with terror, flew to the other end,\n",
      "dragging Rod after him. The only lantern in the car was overturned and its\n",
      "light extinguished, so that the struggle between boy and horse was\n",
      "continued in utter darkness. Finally a tremendous bump of the car flung\n",
      "the horse to the floor; and, before he could regain his feet, Rod was\n",
      "sitting on his head. The boy was panting from his exertions, as well as\n",
      "bruised from head to foot; but he was thankful to feel that no bones were\n",
      "broken, and hoped the horse had escaped serious injury as well as himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several minutes of quiet he became satisfied that that last bump\n",
      "was the end of the drilling, and that car number 1160 had at length\n",
      "reached its assigned position in the train. Still he did not think it safe\n",
      "to let the horse up just yet, and so he waited until he heard voices\n",
      "outside. Then he called for help. The next moment the car door was pushed\n",
      "open, and Conductor Tobin, followed by Brakeman Joe, entered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll be everlastingly blowed!\" cried Conductor Tobin, using the\n",
      "very strongest form of his peculiar expression, as the light from his\n",
      "lantern fell on the strange tableau presented by the boy and horse. \"If\n",
      "this doesn't beat all the stock-tending I ever heard of. Joe here was just\n",
      "telling me you was going out with us to-night, in charge of a horse, and\n",
      "we were looking for your car. But what are you doing to him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sitting on his head,\" answered Rod, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I see,\" said Conductor Tobin, \"and you look very comfortable; but how\n",
      "does he like it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't suppose he likes it at all,\" replied the boy; \"but I couldn't\n",
      "think of anything else to do.\" Then he told them of the terror inspired in\n",
      "the animal by the recent drilling; how it had broken loose and dragged\n",
      "him up and down the car, and how he came to occupy his present position.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you've got sand!\" remarked Conductor Tobin admiringly when the\n",
      "story was finished. \"More 'n I have,\" he added. \"I wouldn't have stayed\n",
      "here in the dark, with a loose horse tearing round like mad. Not for a\n",
      "month's pay I wouldn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more would I,\" said Brakeman Joe; \"a scared hoss is a terror.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they brought some stout ropes, and Juniper was helped to his feet,\n",
      "securely fastened and soothed and petted until all his recent terror was\n",
      "forgotten. To Rod's great delight he was found to be uninjured, except for\n",
      "some insignificant scratches; and by his recent experience he was so well\n",
      "broken to railroad riding that he endured the long trip that followed with\n",
      "the utmost composure.\n",

      "\n",
      "After quieting Juniper, and having the satisfaction of seeing him begin to\n",
      "eat hay quite as though he were in his own stable, Rod left the car and\n",
      "followed his railroad friends in order to learn something about getting a\n",
      "train ready for its run. He found them walking on opposite sides of it,\n",
      "examining each car by the light of their lanterns, and calling to each\n",
      "other the inscriptions on the little leaden seals by which the doors were\n",
      "fastened. These told where the cars came from, which information, together\n",
      "with the car numbers, and the initials showing to what road they belonged,\n",
      "Conductor Tobin jotted down in his train-book. He also compared it with\n",
      "similar information noted on certain brown cards, about as wide and twice\n",
      "as long as ordinary playing-cards, a package of which he carried in his\n",
      "hand. The destinations of the several cars could also be learned from\n",
      "these cards, which are called \"running slips.\" Each car in the train was\n",
      "represented by one of them, which would accompany it wherever it went,\n",
      "being handed from one conductor to another, until its final destination\n",
      "was reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, about ten o'clock, through Freight Number 73, to which car\n",
      "number 1160 was attached, received its \"clearance,\" or order to start,\n",
      "from the train-dispatcher, and began to move heavily out from the yard, on\n",
      "to the main west-bound track. Juniper now did not seem to mind the motion\n",
      "of the car in the least; but continued quietly eating his hay as though he\n",
      "had been a railroad traveller all his life. So Rod, who had watched him a\n",
      "little anxiously at first, had nothing to do but stand at the open door of\n",
      "his car and gaze at what scenery the darkness disclosed. Now that he was\n",
      "beginning to comprehend their use, he was deeply interested in the bright\n",
      "red, green, and white lights of the semaphore signals that guarded every\n",
      "switch and siding. He knew that at night a white light displayed from the\n",
      "top of a post, or swung across the track in the form of a lantern, meant\n",
      "safety, a red light meant danger, and a green light meant caution. If it\n",
      "had been daytime he would have seen thin wooden blades, about four feet\n",
      "long by six inches wide, pivoted near the top of the same posts that now\n",
      "displayed the lights. He would have learned that when these stretched out\n",
      "horizontally over the track, their warning colors must be regarded by\n",
      "every engineman; while if they hung down at an angle, no attention need\n",
      "be paid to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a very observant boy, as well as keenly interested in everything to\n",
      "be seen on a railroad, Rod soon discovered that the semaphore lights also\n",
      "appeared at intervals of a few miles along the track, at places where\n",
      "there were no switches, and that these always moved as soon as the train\n",
      "passed them. He afterwards discovered that these guarded the ends of the\n",
      "five-mile blocks, into which the road was divided along its entire length.\n",
      "Each of the stations, at these points, is occupied by a telegraph operator\n",
      "who, as soon as the train enters his block, displays a red danger signal\n",
      "behind it. This forbids any other train to enter the block, on that track,\n",
      "until he receives word from the operator at the other end of the block\n",
      "that the first train has passed out of it. Then he changes his signal\n",
      "from red to white, as a notice that the block is free for the admission of\n",
      "the next train. This \"block system,\" as it is called, which is now in use\n",
      "on all principal railroad lines, renders travel over them very much safer\n",
      "than it used to be before the system was devised.\n",
      "\n",
      "After watching the semaphore lights for some time, and after assuring\n",
      "himself that Juniper was riding comfortably, Rod spread a blanket, that\n",
      "Brakeman Joe had loaned him, over a pile of loose hay, placed his M. I. P.\n",
      "bag for a pillow, and in a few minutes was sleeping on this rude bed as\n",
      "soundly as though he were at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some hours later the long, heavily laden train stopped at the foot of the\n",
      "steep grade just east of Euston, and was cut in two in order that half of\n",
      "it might be drawn to the top at a time. Rear Brakeman Joe was left to\n",
      "guard the part of the train that remained behind, and he did this by\n",
      "walking back a few hundred yards along the track, and placing a torpedo on\n",
      "top of one of the rails. Then he went back as much farther and placed two\n",
      "torpedoes, one a rail's length behind the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "These railroad torpedoes are small, round tin boxes, about the size of\n",
      "a silver dollar, filled with percussion powder. To each is attached two\n",
      "little straps of lead, which are bent under the upper part of the rail to\n",
      "hold the torpedo in position. When it is struck by the ponderous wheels\n",
      "of a locomotive, it explodes with the sound of a cannon cracker. The\n",
      "explosion of two torpedoes, one directly after the other, is the signal\n",
      "for caution, and bids the engineman proceed slowly, keeping a sharp\n",
      "lookout for danger. The explosion of a single torpedo is the signal of\n",
      "immediate danger, and bids him stop his train as quickly as possible. Thus\n",
      "Brakeman Joe had protected his train by arranging a cautionary signal,\n",
      "which would be followed immediately by that of danger. Before his train\n",
      "started again he intended to take up the single torpedo, leaving only\n",
      "those calling for caution, to show that the freight had been delayed. In\n",
      "the meantime he decided to walk back to the cars left in his charge and\n",
      "see that no one was meddling with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod was too soundly asleep to know anything of all this, nor did he know\n",
      "when an ugly-looking fellow peered cautiously into his car, and said, in a\n",
      "low tone: \"This here ain't it. It must be the one ahead.\" The first thing\n",
      "of which he was conscious was hearing, as in a dream, the sound of blows,\n",
      "mingled with shouts, and a pistol shot, and then Brakeman Joe's voice\n",
      "calling: \"Rod! Rod Blake! Help! quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An instant later the boy had leaped from the car, and was by his friend's\n",
      "side, engaged in a desperate struggle with four as villainous-looking\n",
      "tramps as could well be found; though, of course, he could not judge of\n",
      "their appearance in the darkness. Joe was wielding the heavy oak stick\n",
      "that at other times he used as a lever to aid him in twisting the brake\n",
      "wheels; but Rod was obliged to depend entirely on his fists. The skill\n",
      "with which he used these was evidently a surprise to the big fellow who\n",
      "rushed at him, only to receive a stinging blow in the face, which was\n",
      "followed by others delivered with equal promptness and effect. There were\n",
      "a few minutes of fierce but confused fighting. Then, all at once, Rod\n",
      "found himself standing alone beside a car the door of which was half-way\n",
      "open. Two of the tramps had mysteriously disappeared; he himself had sent\n",
      "a third staggering backward down the bank into a clump of bushes, and he\n",
      "could hear Brakeman Joe chasing the fourth down the track.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes later the locomotive came back, sounding four long blasts\n",
      "and one short one on its whistle, as a recall signal for the rear flagman.\n",
      "It was coupled on, and some one waved a lantern, with an up-and-down\n",
      "motion, from the rear of the train, as a signal to go ahead. The engineman\n",
      "opened the throttle, and the great driving wheels spun round furiously;\n",
      "but the train refused to move. He sounded two long whistle blasts as a\n",
      "signal to throw off brakes. Then a lantern was seen moving over the tops\n",
      "of the cars, the brakes that had been holding them, were loosened, and the\n",
      "signal to go ahead was again waved. After this the lantern disappeared as\n",
      "though it had been taken into the caboose, and the train moved on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its severed parts were re-united at the top of the grade, and it passed\n",
      "on out of the block in which all these events had taken place, before\n",
      "Conductor Tobin, who had wondered somewhat at not seeing Brakeman Joe,\n",
      "discovered that the faithful fellow was missing. He was not on top of any\n",
      "of the cars, nor in the caboose, and must have been left behind. Well, it\n",
      "was too late to stop for him now. Freight Number 73 must side-track at the\n",
      "next station, to allow the night express to pass, and it had already been\n",
      "so delayed, that there was no time to lose.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the station was reached, and Conductor Tobin had seen his train\n",
      "safely side-tracked, he went to look for Rod Blake. He meant to ask the\n",
      "boy to take Brakeman Joe's place for the rest of the run, or until that\n",
      "individual should rejoin them by coming ahead on some faster train. To his\n",
      "surprise the young stockman was not in car number 1160, nor could a trace\n",
      "of him be found. He, too, had disappeared and the conductor began to feel\n",
      "somewhat alarmed, as well as puzzled, by such a curious and unaccountable\n",
      "state of affairs.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Rod Blake was left standing alone beside the train, after the short\n",
      "but sharp encounter with tramps described in the preceding chapter, he was\n",
      "as bewildered by its sudden termination as he had been, on awaking from a\n",
      "sound sleep, to find himself engaged in it. He knew what had become of two\n",
      "of the tramps, for one of them he had sent staggering backward down the\n",
      "embankment, and Brakeman Joe was at that moment pursuing the second; but\n",
      "the disappearance of the others was a mystery. What could have become of\n",
      "them? They must have slipped away unnoticed, and taken advantage of the\n",
      "darkness to make good their escape. \"Yes, that must be it; for tramps are\n",
      "always cowards,\" thought the boy. \"But four of them ought to have whipped\n",
      "two of us easy enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he wondered what the object of the attack could have been, and what\n",
      "the tramps were after. All at once it flashed into his mind that the M. S.\n",
      "and T. car number 50, beside which he was standing, was filled with costly\n",
      "silks and laces from France which were being sent West in bond. He had\n",
      "overheard Conductor Tobin say so; and, now, there was the door of that\n",
      "very car half-way open. The tramps must have learned of its valuable\n",
      "contents in some way, and been attempting to rob it when Brakeman Joe\n",
      "discovered them. What a plucky fellow Joe was to tackle them\n",
      "single-handed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if they got anything before he caught them?\" thought the boy;\n",
      "and, to satisfy his curiosity on this point, he went to his own car for\n",
      "the lantern that was still hanging in it, and returned to car number 50,\n",
      "determined to have a look at its interior. As he could not see much of it\n",
      "from the ground, he set the lantern just within the open doorway, and\n",
      "began to climb in after it. He had hardly stepped inside, and was stooping\n",
      "to pick up his lantern, when he was knocked down by a heavy blow, and\n",
      "immediately seized by two men who sprang from out of the darkness on\n",
      "either side of him. Without a word they bound his wrists with a stout bit\n",
      "of cord, and, thrusting his own handkerchief into his mouth, fastened it\n",
      "securely so that he could not utter a sound. Then they allowed him to rise\n",
      "and sit on a box, where they took the precaution of passing a rope about\n",
      "his body and making it fast to an iron stanchion near the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having thus secured him, one of the men, holding the lantern close to the\n",
      "boy's face, said in a threatening tone: \"Now, my chicken, perhaps this'll\n",
      "be a lesson to you never to interfere again in a business that doesn't\n",
      "concern you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello!\" exclaimed the other, as he recognized Rod's features, \"if this\n",
      "ere hain't the same cove wot set the dog onto me last night. Oh, you young\n",
      "willin, I'll get even with you now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With this he made a motion as though to strike the helpless prisoner; but\n",
      "the other tramp restrained him, saying: \"Hold on, Bill, we hain't got no\n",
      "time for fooling now. Don't you hear the engine coming back? I'll take\n",
      "this lantern and give 'em the signal to go ahead, in case that fool of a\n",
      "brakeman doesn't turn up on time, which I don't believe he will.\" Here the\n",
      "fellow chuckled meaningly. \"You,\" he continued, \"want to stay right here,\n",
      "and begin to pitch out the boxes as soon as she starts, and the rest of\n",
      "us'll be on hand to gather 'em in. You can easy jump out when she slows up\n",
      "at the top of the grade. You want to be sure, though, and shut the door\n",
      "behind you so as nothing won't be suspected, and so this chap'll have a\n",

      "\n",
      "If Rod could not talk, he could still hear; and, by paying close attention\n",
      "to this conversation, he formed a very clear idea of the tramps' plans.\n",
      "They meant to rob car number 50 of as many of its valuable packages as\n",
      "Bill could throw from it while the train was on the grade. He felt\n",
      "satisfied that they had, in some way, disposed of Brakeman Joe. Now, they\n",
      "intended to get rid of him by leaving him in the closed car, helplessly\n",
      "bound, and unable to call for assistance. What would become of him? That\n",
      "car might be going to San Francisco for aught he knew, and its door might\n",
      "not be opened for days, or even weeks. It might not be opened until he was\n",
      "dead of thirst or starvation. What tortures might he not suffer in this\n",
      "moving prison? It seemed as though these thoughts would drive him crazy,\n",
      "and he realized that if he wished to retain his senses and think out a\n",
      "way of escape, he must not dwell upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.--(_Page 81._)]\n",
      "\n",
      "So he tried to think of plans for outwitting the tramps. The chances of so\n",
      "doing seemed slender enough; but he felt certain there must be some way.\n",
      "In the meantime one of his assailants had left the car, very nearly\n",
      "closing the door as he did so for fear lest somebody might come along and\n",
      "notice it if it were wide open. He had taken the lantern with him, the\n",
      "train was in motion, the young tramp called Bill was already preparing to\n",
      "carry out his part of the programme and begin throwing out the boxes.\n",
      "Suddenly, like a flash of lightning, a plan that would not only save the\n",
      "car from being robbed, but would ensure its door being opened before he\n",
      "could die of either thirst or hunger, darted into Rod's mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that the car door closed with a spring latch that could only be\n",
      "opened from the outside. He knew that no one could board the train, now\n",
      "that it was in motion, to open the door. Above all he knew that if the\n",
      "young tramp were shut in there with him he would not suffer long from\n",
      "hunger and thirst before raising his voice and making his presence known\n",
      "to outsiders. Rod could reach the door with his foot. A quick push, the\n",
      "welcome click of the latch as it sprang sharply into place, and the plan\n",
      "was carried out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took Bill, the young tramp, several minutes to find out what had\n",
      "happened, and that the door could not be opened from the inside. When he\n",
      "finally realized his position he broke out with a torrent of yells and\n",
      "threats against his recent companions. It never occurred to him that Rod\n",
      "had closed the door. He imagined that it must have been done from the\n",
      "outside, by one of his fellow thieves, and his rage against them knew no\n",
      "bounds. If he had for a moment suspected the captive, whom he regarded as\n",
      "helplessly bound, he would undoubtedly have directed his fury towards him,\n",
      "and Rod might have suffered severely at his hands. As it was, he only\n",
      "yelled and kicked against the door until the train began to slow up at the\n",
      "top of the grade. Then, fearful of attracting undesirable attention, he\n",
      "subsided into a sullen silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these things were happening to Rod, Brakeman Joe was suffering even\n",
      "greater misfortunes. His left arm had been broken by the pistol shot, that\n",
      "was one of the first sounds of the fight by which the young stockman was\n",
      "awakened; and when he started in pursuit of the flying tramp, he was\n",
      "weaker than he realized, from loss of blood. The tramp quickly discovered\n",

      "the butt of a revolver, that stretched him senseless across the rails of\n",

      "For ten minutes Brakeman Joe lies insensible and motionless, just as\n",
      "he fell. His own train has gone on without him, and now another is\n",
      "approaching. Its shrill whistle sounds near at hand, and the rails, across\n",
      "which the helpless form is stretched, are already quivering with the\n",
      "thrill of its coming. There seems no earthly help for him; nothing to warn\n",
      "the controlling mind of that on-rushing mass of his presence. In a few\n",
      "seconds the tragedy will be over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, crack! crack! two loud reports ring out sharply above the roar\n",
      "and rattle of the train, one just after the other. The engineman is keenly\n",
      "alert on the instant; and, with one hand on the brake lever, the other on\n",
      "the throttle, he peers steadily ahead. The head-light, that seems so\n",
      "dazzling, and to cast its radiance so far, to those approaching it, in\n",
      "reality illumines but a short space to him who sits behind it, and the\n",
      "engineman sees no evidence of danger. There is no red beacon to stop him,\n",
      "nor any train on the track ahead. He is beginning to think the alarm a\n",
      "false one, when another report, loud and imperative, rings in his startled\n",
      "ear. In an instant the powerful air brakes are grinding against the wheels\n",
      "of every car in the night express, until the track is lighted with a blaze\n",
      "of streaming sparks. A moment later the rushing train is brought to a\n",
      "stop, inside half its own length.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even now nobody knew why it had been stopped, nor what danger threatened\n",
      "it. It was not until the engineman left his cab, and discovered the\n",
      "senseless form of Brakeman Joe lying across the rails, less than a hundred\n",
      "feet away, that he knew why he had been signalled. The wounded man was\n",
      "recognized at once, as belonging to the train ahead of them; but how he\n",
      "came in that sad plight, and who had placed the warning torpedoes to which\n",
      "he owed his escape from death, were perplexing questions that none could\n",
      "answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very tenderly they lifted him, and laid him in the baggage car. Here\n",
      "Conductor Tobin found him a few minutes later, when, to his surprise, the\n",
      "night express, that generally whirled past him at full speed, slowed up\n",
      "and halted beside his own train, standing on the siding. \"Yes,\" this was\n",
      "his brakeman, one of the best and most faithful fellows in the service;\n",
      "but how he got where they found him, or what had happened, he could not\n",
      "explain. He had lost another man off his train that night, a young fellow\n",
      "named Rodman Blake. Had they seen anything of him? \"No! well, then he\n",
      "must have thrown up his job and gone into Euston where he belonged.\n",
      "Good-night.\" In another minute only a far-away murmur among the sleeping\n",
      "hills told of the passing of the night express.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brakeman Joe was placed on the station agent's little cot bed, and the\n",
      "doctor was sent for. That was all they could do, and so Freight Number 73\n",
      "also pulled out, leaving him behind. A minute later, and it too was gone,\n",
      "and the drowsy echoes answered its heavy rumblings faintly and more\n",
      "faintly, until they again fell asleep, and all was still.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the long hours of the night Rod Blake sat and silently suffered.\n",
      "The distress of the gag in his mouth became wellnigh intolerable, and his\n",
      "wrists swelled beneath the cords that bound them, until he could have\n",
      "cried out with the pain. He grew thirsty too. Oh, so thirsty! and it\n",
      "seemed as though the daylight would never come. He had no idea what\n",
      "good, or even what change for the better, the daylight would bring him;\n",
      "but still he longed for it. Nor was the young tramp who shared his\n",
      "imprisonment at all happy or comfortable. He too was thirsty, and hungry\n",
      "as well, and though he was not gagged nor bound, he suffered, in\n",
      "anticipation, the punishment he expected to receive when he and his\n",
      "wickedness should be discovered. Thus, whenever the train stopped, a sense\n",
      "of his just deserts terrified him into silence; though while it was in\n",
      "motion his ravings were terrible to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the morning light began to show itself through chinks and\n",
      "crevices of the closed car. Conductor Tobin and his men reached the end of\n",
      "their run, and turned the train over to a new crew, who brought with them\n",
      "a fresh locomotive and their own caboose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the young tramp would not give in. The morning was nearly gone,\n",
      "and Rod was desperate with suffering, before he did, and, during a stop,\n",
      "began to shout to be let out. Nobody heard him, apparently, and when the\n",
      "train again moved on, the situation of the prisoners was as bad as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the fellow began to grow as much alarmed for fear he would not be\n",
      "discovered, as he had previously been for fear lest he should be. In this\n",
      "state of mind he decided that at the next stop the shouting for help\n",
      "should be undertaken by two voices instead of one. So he removed the gag\n",
      "from Rod's mouth, and cut the cord by which his wrists were bound. The\n",
      "poor lad's throat was dry and husky; but he readily agreed to aid in\n",
      "raising a shout, as soon as the train should stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime the arrival of Freight Number 73 was awaited with a lively\n",

      "between the prisoners was made. It was aroused by a despatch, just sent\n",
      "along the line by the agent in whose charge Brakeman Joe had been left.\n",
      "The despatch stated that he had recovered sufficiently to give a partial\n",
      "account of what had been done to him by a gang of thieves, whom he had\n",
      "discovered trying to rob car number 50. It requested the first agent who\n",
      "should see Train Number 73, to examine into the condition of car number\n",
      "50, and discover if anything had been stolen from it. It also stated that\n",
      "Brakeman Joe was very anxious concerning the safety of a young stockman,\n",
      "who had been on the train, and assisted him to drive off the thieves; but\n",
      "who had not since been heard from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, while the imprisoned inmates of car number 50 were waiting with\n",
      "feverish impatience for the train to reach a station at which it would\n",
      "stop, the railroad men belonging to this station, were waiting for it with\n",

      "make a combined effort for liberty was at hand. It also notified the\n",
      "curious watchers at the station of the approach of the train for which\n",
      "they were waiting. The trainmen were surprised at the unusual number of\n",
      "people gathered about the station, and the evident interest with which\n",
      "their arrival was regarded. At the same time those composing the little\n",
      "throng of waiting spectators were amazed, as the train drew up and\n",
      "stopped, to hear loud cries for help proceeding from a car in its centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's number 50!\" exclaimed one, \"the very car we are looking for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is! Break open the door! Some one is being murdered in there!\"\n",
      "shouted other voices, and a rush was made for the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "As its door was pushed open, by a dozen eager hands, a wretched-looked\n",
      "figure, who had evidently been pressing closely against it, and was\n",
      "unprepared for such a sudden movement, pitched out headlong into the\n",
      "crowd. As he staggered to his feet he tried to force his way through them,\n",
      "with the evident intention of running away; but he was seized and held.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the whole attention of the spectators was directed toward\n",
      "him, and he was stupefied by the multitude of questions showered upon him\n",
      "at once. Then some one cried \"Look out! There's another in there!\" and\n",
      "immediately poor Rod was roughly dragged to the ground. \"Take them into\n",
      "the waiting-room, and see that they don't escape while I examine the car.\n",
      "There may be more of the gang hidden in there,\" commanded the station\n",
      "agent. So to the waiting-room the prisoners were hustled with scant\n",
      "ceremony. As yet no one knew what they had done, nor even what they were\n",
      "charged with doing; but every one agreed that they were two of the\n",
      "toughest looking young villains ever seen in that part of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the confusion, no one had paid any attention to the arrival, from\n",
      "the west, of a locomotive drawing a single car. Nor did they notice a\n",
      "brisk, business-like appearing man who left this car, and walked, with\n",
      "a quick step, toward the waiting-room. Every one therefore looked up in\n",
      "surprise when he entered it and demanded, in a tone of authority, \"What's\n",
      "the trouble here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly a murmur was heard of, \"It's the superintendent. It's the\n",
      "'super' himself\"; and, as the crowd respectfully made way for him, a dozen\n",
      "of voices were raised in attempted explanation of what had happened. As no\n",
      "one really knew what had happened, no two of the voices told the same\n",
      "story; but the superintendent catching the words \"murderers, thieves,\n",
      "tramps, brakeman killed, and car robbed,\" became convinced that he had a\n",
      "most serious case on his hands, and that the disreputable-looking young\n",
      "fellows before him must be exceedingly dangerous characters. In order to\n",
      "arrive at an understanding of the case more quickly, he ordered the room\n",
      "to be cleared of all except the prisoners, the station agent, and the\n",
      "trainmen of Freight Number 73, whom he told to guard the doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "He first examined the conductor, who was as surprised as any one else to\n",
      "find that he had been carrying two passengers of whom he knew nothing on\n",
      "his train. He had no information to give, excepting what Conductor Tobin\n",
      "had told him, and what the superintendent had already learned by\n",
      "telegraph, of Brakeman Joe's condition. The other trainmen knew nothing\n",

      "Here the superintendent dismissed the trainmen, and ordered Freight Number\n",
      "73 to go ahead. Then, with new guards stationed at the doors, he proceeded\n",
      "to question the prisoners themselves. As Bill, the tramp, seemed to be the\n",
      "elder of the two, he was the first examined. In answer to the questions\n",
      "who he was, where he came from, and what he had been doing in car number\n",

      "\n",
      "\"If you'll please give me a drink of water I'll try to tell all I know of\n",

      "\n",
      "When the water was brought, and Bill had been given a drink as well as\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Jest as I was a-tellin' yer Honor,\" murmured Bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And there was a fight with tramps, who attempted to rob the car in which\n",
      "we were found.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Bill nodded his head approvingly as much as to say \"I told you so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But this fellow was one of them, and he helped make a prisoner of me, and\n",
      "to bind and gag me. He would have thrown the freight out of the car to\n",
      "those who were waiting outside to receive it, if I hadn't succeeded in\n",
      "closing the door, and locking us both in--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ooo! didn't I tell yer Honor he'd maybe lie on me?\" protested Bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep quiet!\" commanded the superintendent sharply, and then to Rod he\n",
      "said: \"How can you prove your statements?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can prove that I was bound and gagged by these marks,\" replied the boy,\n",
      "pointing to the sides of his mouth which were red and chafed, and holding\n",
      "out his swollen wrists for the superintendent's inspection. \"And I can\n",
      "prove that I was travelling in charge of a horse by this.\" Here Rod\n",
      "produced the note from Juniper's owner, asking his brother to pay the\n",
      "bearer two dollars and a half upon the safe delivery of the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have a paper too,\" broke in Bill, fumbling in his pockets. From one of\n",
      "them he finally produced a dirty note, signed by a Western cattle dealer,\n",
      "and authorizing one Bill Miner to take charge of certain stock about to\n",
      "be shipped over the New York and Western railroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The superintendent read the two notes, and looked at the two young\n",
      "fellows. In general appearance one was very nearly as bad as the other;\n",
      "for, though Rod did not realize the fact, his clothing and person were so\n",
      "torn and dirty from the fight of the preceding night and his subsequent\n",
      "rough experience, that he looked very nearly as much of a tramp as Bill\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder which of you I am to believe, or if either is telling me the\n",

      "At that moment a small dog walked into the room, wagging his tail with an\n",
      "air of being perfectly at home there. Rod was the first to notice him, and\n",
      "his eye lighted with a gleam of genuine pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Smiler? Smiler, old dog!\" he said.\n",

      "growl, would have flown at the young tramp had not Rodman restrained him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That settles it, so far as I am concerned,\" exclaimed the superintendent,\n",
      "with a relieved air. \"Any one that Smiler recognizes as a friend must be\n",
      "an honest fellow; while the person whom Smiler calls an enemy, must have\n",
      "given him good cause for his enmity, and is to be regarded with distrust\n",
      "by all railroad men. Now, I am going to carry you two chaps to the\n",
      "Junction where Conductor Tobin and his crew are lying off to-day. There,\n",
      "I have no doubt, this whole matter will be explained satisfactorily to me\n",
      "and to one of you, as well as with perfect justice to you both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Smiler, who had reached this station on a passenger locomotive, now\n",
      "attached himself resolutely to Rod, and followed him into the\n",
      "superintendent's private car, here he was made as cordially welcome as\n",
      "he would have been in the humblest caboose on the road. Some of his\n",

      "admitted that there was but one other individual connected with it, whose\n",
      "appearance was so uniformly welcome as his, and that was the paymaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there was a marked difference shown between the treatment of Smiler's\n",
      "friend, and that of his enemy. The former was invited to sit down with the\n",
      "superintendent and eat dinner, which was announced as ready soon after\n",
      "they left the station; but Bill was consigned to the care of a brakeman\n",
      "who received strict orders not to give him a chance to escape. He was\n",
      "given a substantial meal of course; for Mr. Hill the superintendent was\n",
      "not a man who would permit anybody to suffer from hunger if he could help\n",
      "it. Here the courtesy extended to him ended, and he was treated in all\n",
      "respects like a prisoner. Most of the time he rode in sullen silence; but\n",
      "occasionally he broke forth with vehement protestations of his innocence,\n",
      "and of the truth of the story he had told.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rodman, on the other hand, was treated with marked consideration; for,\n",
      "not only was he a friend of Smiler's, but the more Mr. Hill talked with\n",
      "him the more he believed him to be a gentleman, as well as an honest,\n",
      "truth-telling lad, who had, by a brave and prompt action, saved the\n",
      "railroad company a large amount of property. He was confirmed in his\n",
      "belief that Rod was a gentleman, by his having asked to be allowed to wash\n",
      "his face and hands before sitting down to dinner. The lad was shocked at\n",
      "his own appearance when he glanced into a mirror, and the superintendent\n",
      "smiled at the wonderful change made by the use of soap, water, and\n",
      "brushes, when he emerged from the well-appointed dressing-room of the\n",
      "car.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they sat at table Mr. Hill drew the lad's story from him, including\n",
      "the manner in which he had obtained Smiler's friendship, and his desire to\n",
      "become a railroad man. Rod did not however mention the name of President\n",
      "Vanderveer; for he was desirous of winning success by himself, and on his\n",
      "own merits, nor did he give his reasons for leaving Euston.\n",
      "\n",

      "asked to remain in the car for a few minutes, and Bill was ordered to do\n",
      "so. Then Mr. Hill walked over to caboose number 18, in which, as he\n",
      "expected, he found Conductor Tobin and his two brakemen fast asleep, with\n",
      "bits of mosquito netting spread over their faces to keep off the flies.\n",
      "Conductor Tobin was greatly confused when he discovered who was shaking\n",
      "him into wakefulness, and began to apologize for having been asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No excuses are necessary, Tobin,\" said the other kindly. \"A man who works\n",
      "as faithfully as you do at night, has a perfect right to sleep in the\n",
      "daytime. I wouldn't have disturbed you, but that I wanted to ask if you\n",
      "were acquainted with a young fellow named Rod Blake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed! Conductor Tobin not only knew the lad, but was, at that\n",
      "moment, quite anxious concerning him. He had learned by telegraph from\n",
      "Brakeman Joe, further particulars of the occurrences of the preceding\n",
      "night, including Rod's splendid behavior during the fight with the\n",
      "would-be thieves. Since then nothing had been heard from him, and the\n",
      "conductor greatly feared that the brave young fellow had met with some\n",
      "harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you consider him a person whose word is to be trusted?\" asked the\n",
      "superintendent.\n",
      "\n",

      "of him to be willing to take his word as quick as that of any man living.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is saying a good deal,\" laughed the superintendent, \"but I believe\n",
      "you are right. If I am any judge of character, that lad is an honest\n",
      "fellow.\" Then he explained how, and under what circumstances he had met\n",
      "Rod, and ending by asking, \"What sort of a railroad man do you think he\n",
      "would make?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Bill Miner, the tramp, underwent some novel mental experiences on the day\n",
      "that Rod obtained his position. In the first place the young fellow, whom\n",
      "he had treated so badly, came to him while the superintendent was\n",
      "interviewing Conductor Tobin, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here, Bill, you and I suffered a good deal together last night, and\n",
      "you know it was mostly your fault that we did so; but I'll forgive you for\n",
      "my share of the suffering if you'll only confess the whole business to the\n",
      "superintendent. He is bound to find out all about it anyway; for he finds\n",
      "out everything; but he'll think a good deal more of you if you own up\n",
      "like a man. I would like to be your friend; but my friends must be honest\n",
      "fellows, who are willing to work for a living, not tramps and thieves. Now\n",
      "shake hands, and make up your mind to do what I have asked you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hill's return interrupted the conversation at this point; but it left\n",
      "Bill in an unusually reflective state of mind. No gentleman, such as his\n",
      "late companion in captivity evidently was, had ever shaken hands with, or\n",
      "asked a favor of him before. In all his hard young life no one had ever\n",
      "proposed that he should try honesty and hard work. Ever since he could\n",
      "remember anything, his associates had advised dishonesty, and the shirking\n",
      "of work in every possible way. Yet, now that he thought of it, he had\n",
      "worked hard, all his life, at being dishonest. Now what had he to show for\n",
      "it? Nothing but rags, and poverty, and a bad reputation. He wondered how\n",
      "it would seem to be honest, and do honest work, and associate only with\n",
      "honest people. He had half a mind to try it, just out of curiosity. The\n",
      "idea of he, Bill the tramp, being an honest workman, and perhaps, even\n",
      "getting to be called \"Honest Bill,\" struck him as so odd that he chuckled\n",
      "hoarsely over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you laughing at?\" demanded the brakeman who stood on the rear\n",
      "platform of the car to prevent his escape, and who looked suspiciously in\n",
      "at the door to discover the meaning of this novel sound from his\n",
      "prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" replied Bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I wish I could get so much fun out of nothing as you seem able to,\"\n",

      "funny,\" he added significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bill did not mind this. He was too busy with his own thoughts. Besides\n",
      "he was used to such speeches, and was also listening to something else\n",
      "just at that moment. He was listening to the conversation between Rod and\n",
      "the superintendent. It certainly was a fine thing for a boy to be talked\n",
      "to as the greatest man he had ever known was now talking to his one honest\n",
      "friend, and to be offered such a position too. How he would like to be a\n",
      "brakeman; and, if he were one, how well he would know how to deal with\n",
      "tramps. He wondered what Mr. Hill meant by being \"on time.\" Perhaps it\n",
      "meant being honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Rod left the car, giving him a nod and a smile as he did so. A moment\n",
      "later it was again whirling away toward New York, and the superintendent,\n",
      "coming to where the young tramp was sitting, said: \"Now, sir, I'm ready to\n",
      "attend to your case. Are you willing to tell me what you know about this\n",
      "business of robbing our freight trains? Or do you prefer to stick to your\n",
      "lying story and go to prison for it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you all I know, if you'll give me a job for it,\" answered Bill,\n",

      "same time to make a good bargain for himself if he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding him keenly, the superintendent said: \"So you want to be paid for\n",
      "being honest, do you? Well, I don't know but what you are right. Honesty\n",
      "is well worth paying for. So, if you will tell me, truthfully, all you\n",
      "know of this business I promise you a job that will earn you an honest\n",
      "living, and that you can keep just so long as you work faithfully at it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Honesty again. How often these gentlemen use the word, and how much\n",
      "they seem to think of it,\" thought Bill. However, as it seemed to promise\n",
      "something different from anything he had ever known, he determined to try\n",
      "it, and see what it would do for him. So he told, in his awkward fashion,\n",
      "all that he knew of the gang of tramp thieves, who had been for some time\n",
      "systematically robbing freight trains at several points along the road,\n",
      "and Mr. Hill listened to him with the deepest interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a speedy result of this confession a freight clerk in the main office\n",
      "of the company, who had been giving secret information to the thieves,\n",
      "was discharged the very next day. Brown, the chief of the company's\n",
      "detectives, learned where and how he could discover the places where the\n",
      "stolen goods were hidden, and was thus enabled to recover a large portion\n",
      "of them. And Bill Miner, no longer Bill the tramp, found himself doing\n",
      "honest work, as a locomotive wiper and assistant hostler, in a round\n",
      "house, at a salary of one dollar and twenty-nine cents per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly Rod Blake's influence was being felt on the New York and Western\n",
      "railroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "After his conversation with Bill, the busy superintendent found time to\n",
      "stop his flying car at the station where Brakeman Joe lay suffering from\n",
      "his wounds, to speak a few kindly words to the faithful fellow, praise his\n",
      "bravery, and assure him that his full pay should be continued until he\n",

      "\n",
      "Late that afternoon the private car finished its long journey in the\n",
      "station at the terminus of the road, and Mr. Hill hastened to his own\n",
      "office. The moment he opened the door of the inner room a cloud of\n",
      "cigarette smoke issued from it, and a frown settled on his face as he\n",
      "hesitated a moment on the threshold. His private secretary, who had been\n",
      "comfortably tilted back in the superintendent's own easy chair, puffing\n",
      "wreathes of smoke from a cigarette, started to his feet. \"We did not\n",
      "expect you to return so soon, sir\"--he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Evidently not,\" interrupted Mr. Hill dryly; \"You are the young man\n",

      "smoking among the qualifications required of our employees. If you must\n",
      "smoke during business hours, I will endeavor to fill your position with\n",
      "somebody who is not under that necessity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next half hour Snyder Appleby sat at his own desk, for once in\n",
      "his life hard at work, and feeling that he had been decidedly snubbed if\n",
      "not actually insulted. He was even meditating the handing in of his\n",

      "\"Yes, sir. I have an acquaintance there of that name,\" replied Snyder\n",

      "in Rod Blake. \"The fact is,\" he added with an assumed air of frankness,\n",
      "\"the young person in question is a sort of adopted cousin of my own; but\n",
      "circumstances have arisen that lead me to consider him an undesirable\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What are they?\" inquired the superintendent bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would hardly be becoming in me to state them,\" replied Snyder, wishing\n",
      "he knew why the other was making these inquiries. \"I should be very sorry\n",
      "to say anything that might injure the young man's future prospects.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had they anything to do with his leaving Euston, and seeking employment\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir; I think they had,\" admitted Snyder with apparent reluctance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I consider it your duty to tell me what they are,\" said Mr. Hill;\n",
      "\"for I have just given young Blake the position of brakeman, and if there\n",
      "is any reason why he is unfit for it I should like to know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This aroused all the jealousy in Snyder's nature and he answered: \"Well,\n",
      "sir, if you put it in that light, I suppose I must tell you that Blake's\n",
      "uncle, with whom he lived, turned him from the house without a penny in\n",
      "his pocket on account of his connection with a most infamous piece of\n",
      "rascality. But I beg that you will not question me any further on the\n",
      "subject. It is most painful to me to speak of even a distant connection\n",
      "in the terms I should be obliged to use in referring to Rodman Blake.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The President has gone West on a business trip that will occupy some\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime Rod, who was happily ignorant of this conversation, had\n",
      "been warmly welcomed in caboose number 18. There Conductor Tobin and the\n",
      "two brakemen listened with intense interest to all he had to tell them\n",
      "of his recent experiences. They in turn informed him of Brakeman Joe's\n",
      "condition, and of how the torpedoes had saved him from being run over by\n",
      "the night express.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found his M. I. P. bag in the caboose where Conductor Tobin had been\n",
      "keeping it until he should hear from him. The conductor also handed Rod\n",
      "a ten dollar bill, that had been left for him by the brother of Juniper's\n",
      "owner, as a reward for his gallant struggle with the terrified horse in\n",
      "the closed car, and the subsequent care of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling very rich and independent with this amount of money, of his own\n",
      "earning, at his disposal, Rod at once bought for himself a blue checkered\n",
      "shirt and pair of overalls, a cap, a pair of buckskin gloves with which to\n",
      "handle brake wheels, one of the great tin lunch-pails such as railroad\n",
      "men carry, and a blanket. Thus equipped he felt he was ready for any\n",
      "emergency. To these purchases he added a supply of provisions, and a\n",
      "basket of fruit that he intended to leave for Brakeman Joe when they\n",
      "should pass the station at which he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The train that they were ordered to take came along shortly before sunset.\n",
      "When it again pulled out, drawing caboose number 18, and with Rod Blake,\n",
      "brake-stick in hand, standing on the \"deck\" of one of its rear cars, there\n",
      "was no happier nor prouder lad than he in the country. How he did enjoy\n",
      "the novelty of that first ride on top of a freight train, and what a fine\n",
      "thing it seemed, to be really a railroad man. The night was clear and\n",
      "cold; but the exercise of setting up brakes on down grades, and throwing\n",
      "them off for up grades or level stretches, kept him in a glow of warmth.\n",
      "Then how bright and cosy the interior of the caboose, that was now his\n",
      "home, seemed during the occasional visits that he paid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the night grew dark, Conductor Tobin showed him how to place the\n",
      "two red lanterns on its rear platform, and the lights that showed red\n",
      "behind, green in front, and green at the side, on its upper rear corners.\n",
      "Then he was asked to make a fire in the little round stove, and prepare a\n",
      "huge pot of coffee for the train crew to drink during the night. When\n",
      "there was nothing else to do he might sit up in the cupola, on the side\n",
      "opposite to that occupied by Conductor Tobin; but on this first night he\n",
      "preferred taking his own lantern, and going out on \"deck,\" as the top of\n",
      "the cars is called. Here he was too far from the locomotive to be annoyed\n",
      "by its smoke or cinders, and he loved to feel the cool night air rushing\n",
      "past him. He enjoyed rumbling through the depths of dark forests, and\n",
      "rattling over bridges or long trestles. It was strange to roll heavily\n",
      "through sleeping towns, where the only signs of life were the bright\n",
      "lights of the stations, and the twinkling red, green or white semaphore\n",
      "lights at the switches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the time he amused himself by holding his watch in hand, and\n",
      "counting the clicks of the car wheels over the rail joints; for he\n",
      "remembered having read that the number of rails passed in twenty seconds\n",
      "is almost exactly the number of miles run by a train in an hour. If it had\n",
      "been day time he might also have noted the number of telegraph poles\n",
      "passed in a minute, and calculated the speed of the train, by allowing\n",
      "thirty-five poles to the mile.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time, however, he was under orders to keep a watch on the\n",
      "movements of the brakemen ahead of him, and to set up, or throw off,\n",
      "brakes on at least two of the six cars under his charge, whenever he\n",
      "noticed them doing so. He was surprised to learn that it was by no means\n",
      "necessary to put on all the brakes of a train to check its speed, or even\n",
      "to stop it, and that the application of those on a third, or even a\n",
      "quarter of its cars answered every purpose. He also soon learned to jump\n",
      "quickly whenever brakes were called for by a single short whistle blast\n",
      "from the locomotive, and to throw them off at the order of the two short\n",
      "blasts that called for brakes to be loosened. At first he thought it\n",
      "curious that the other brakemen should run along the tops of the cars, and\n",
      "wondered why they were always in such a hurry. He soon discovered though\n",
      "that it was much easier to keep his footing running than walking, and\n",
      "safer to jump from car to car than to step deliberately across the open\n",
      "spaces between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, during the night, when he and Conductor Tobin were seated in the\n",
      "caboose eating their midnight lunch, the latter began to sniff the air\n",
      "suspiciously, and even to Rod's unaccustomed nostrils, there came a most\n",
      "unpleasant smell. \"Hot box!\" said Conductor Tobin, and the next time they\n",
      "stopped, they found the packing in an iron box at the end of an axle,\n",
      "under one of the cars, blazing at a furious rate. The journals, or\n",
      "bearings, in which the axle turned, had become dry and so heated by\n",
      "friction as to set the oil-soaked cotton waste, or packing, with which the\n",
      "box was filled, on fire. The job of cooling the box with buckets of water,\n",
      "and repacking it with waste, and thick, black, evil-smelling oil was a\n",
      "dirty and disagreeable one, as Rod quickly learned from experience. He\n",
      "also realized from what he saw, that if it were not done in time, the car\n",
      "itself might be set on fire, or the axle broken off.\n",
      "\n",
      "These, and many other valuable lessons in railroading, did Rod Blake\n",
      "learn that night; and when in the gray dawn, the train pulled into the\n",
      "home yard, with its run completed, he was wiser, more sleepy and tired,\n",

      "For several weeks Rod Blake continued to lead the life of a brakeman on\n",
      "Conductor Tobin's train. Although it was a very humble position, and\n",
      "though the life was one of constant danger and hard work, he thoroughly\n",
      "enjoyed it. Blessed with youth, health and a perfect physical condition,\n",
      "he even found pleasure in the stormy nights, when the running boards that\n",
      "formed his pathway over the roofs of the swaying cars were slippery with\n",
      "sleet, and fierce winds tried their best to hurl him from them. He\n",
      "experienced a wild joy in battling with, and conquering, gales that forced\n",
      "him to crawl along the storm-swept \"deck\" on hands and knees, clinging\n",
      "tightly to the running boards, often with lantern extinguished, and making\n",
      "the passage from car to car through pitchy darkness. On such nights how\n",
      "warm and cheerful was the interior of the caboose, when at rare intervals\n",
      "he found a chance to pay it dripping visits! How welcome were the cups of\n",
      "hot coffee from the steaming pot on the glowing stove, and how the\n",
      "appreciation of all its comforts was intensified by the wildness of the\n",
      "outside night!\n",
      "\n",
      "By his unfailing cheerfulness of disposition, his promptness to answer any\n",
      "call, and on account of his splendid athletic training, the lad rapidly\n",
      "extended his circle of friendships, until there was not a trainman on the\n",
      "division but had a word of greeting, or a friendly wave of the hand for\n",
      "him, as they met at stations or were whirled past each other on the road.\n",
      "During the leisure \"lay-off\" hours at either end of the run, he gave them\n",
      "boxing lessons in the caboose. These proved so popular as entertainments\n",
      "that on such occasions the car was always crowded with eager pupils and\n",
      "enthusiastic spectators. In fact, before he had been a month on the road,\n",
      "Rod Blake had attained a popularity among the rough, but honest and manly,\n",
      "fellows who shared his labors, only approached by that of Smiler himself.\n",
      "With this wise animal he was also such a prime favorite that the dog was\n",
      "now more frequently to be seen on his train than on any other.\n",
      "\n",
      "After working as rear brakeman, under Conductor Tobin's especial care,\n",
      "long enough to become thoroughly acquainted with his duties, Rod was, at\n",
      "his own request, transferred to the forward end of the train. Here he had\n",
      "charge of the six or eight cars immediately following the locomotive. This\n",
      "was not nearly so pleasant a position as that at the rear end; for now,\n",
      "while running, he seldom had a chance to visit the caboose, and when on\n",
      "duty he was directly in the path of the very worst of the smoke and\n",
      "cinders. Then too the work here was harder than anywhere else on the\n",
      "train; for, in addition to his regular duties as brakeman, he was expected\n",
      "to assist the fireman at water stations, and by shovelling coal down from\n",
      "the rear end of the tender so that it was more easily within his reach. It\n",
      "was for this very reason though that Rod sought the place. He did not wish\n",
      "to remain a brakeman very long, nor even to become a conductor; but he did\n",
      "want to learn how to run a locomotive, and looked forward with longing\n",
      "anticipation to the day when he might fill the proud position of\n",
      "engineman. So he shovelled coal with a hearty good-will, and seized every\n",
      "opportunity for riding on the locomotive, and carefully watched the\n",
      "movements of the men who managed it. Sometimes he asked questions, but not\n",
      "often; when he did they were of such a nature that the answers were of\n",

      "command sufficient influence to secure his appointment as fireman before\n",
      "he had undergone a preliminary training as wiper and hostler in the\n",

      "\"Tobin? oh no! I know him too well ever to mistake any one else for him. I\n",
      "take you to be Conductor Joseph Miller of the through freight, whose\n",
      "promotion has just been posted, to take effect immediately. I have also\n",

      "aright? Was it possible that he was thus unceremoniously thrown out of\n",
      "work to make a place for his former brakeman? His expression was quite as\n",
      "bewildered as that of Brakeman Joe, and the Superintendent, noticing it,\n",
      "allowed an amused smile to flit across his own face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be alarmed, Tobin,\" he said, reassuringly; \"the Company can't very\n",

      "convenient I should like to have you take out number 29 to-night, and, as\n",

      "same train; that is, if it will be agreeable to you to have him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Number 29! The Continental Express Company's Special! Why, only passenger\n",
      "conductors had that train! What could Mr. Hill mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all right, Tobin,\" continued that gentleman, noting the other's\n",
      "embarrassment; \"your name has gone on to the passenger list, and if you\n",
      "do as well there as you have with your freights I shall be more than\n",
      "satisfied. I hope this change strikes you as being one for the better\n",
      "also?\" he added, turning to Rod.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, only----\" began Rodman, who was about to say something\n",
      "concerning his desire to be made a fireman, when he suddenly remembered\n",
      "that Truman Stump had requested him not to speak of it just yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only what?\" asked Mr. Hill, a little sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was afraid I hadn't experience enough,\" answered Rod.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a matter of which I claim to be the best judge,\" replied the\n",

      "must be ready to leave in half an hour. Good-night and good luck to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Conductor Tobin's long and faithful service, and Brakeman Joe's\n",
      "suffering, and Rod Blake's strict attention to duty were all rewarded at\n",
      "once, though in Rodman's case the reward had not taken exactly the shape\n",
      "he desired. Still, a promotion was a promotion, and where there were so\n",
      "many competitors for each upward step, as there always are on a railroad,\n",
      "it was not for him to grumble at the form in which it came.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as the young railroad man gathered up his few belongings, he gratefully\n",
      "accepted the congratulations of his friends. A few minutes later he bade\n",
      "freight conductor Joe good-by, and in company with passenger conductor\n",
      "Tobin he left caboose number 18 with much the same feeling that a young\n",
      "scholar leaves his primary school for one a grade higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number 29 was a peculiar train, and one that Rod had often watched rush\n",
      "past his side-tracked freight with feelings of deep interest, not unmixed\n",
      "with envy. It always followed the \"Limited,\" with all the latter's\n",
      "privileges of precedence and right of way. Thus it was such a flyer that\n",
      "the contrast between it and the freight, which always had to get out\n",
      "of the way, was as great as that between a thoroughbred racer and a\n",
      "farm-horse. It was made up of express cars, loaded with money, jewelry,\n",
      "plate, and other valuable packages, which caused it to be known along the\n",
      "road as the \"gold mine.\" In its money-car was carried specie and bank\n",
      "notes from the United States Treasury, and from Eastern banks to Western\n",
      "cities. Thus it was no unusual thing for this one car to carry a million\n",
      "dollars' worth of such express matter. Each car was in charge of a trusted\n",
      "and well-armed messenger, who locked himself in from one end of his run to\n",
      "the other, and was prepared to defend the valuables entrusted to his care\n",
      "with his life. Thus number 29 was one of the most important as well as one\n",
      "of the very fastest trains on the road; while to run on it was considered\n",
      "such an honor that many envious glances were cast at Rod as he stood on\n",
      "the platform beside it awaiting the starting-signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been no time for him to procure the blue uniform suit, such as\n",
      "the crews of passenger trains, with whom he now ranked, are required to\n",
      "wear; and as the jumper and overalls of a freight brakeman would have been\n",
      "decidedly out of place on an express special, Rod had hastily donned his\n",
      "best suit of every-day clothes. Thus as he stood near the steps of the\n",
      "single passenger coach that was attached to the train in place of a\n",
      "caboose for the accommodation of its conductor and brakemen, he was not\n",
      "to be distinguished from the throng of passengers hastening aboard the\n",
      "\"Limited\" on the opposite side of the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this reason a young man, with a stout leather travelling bag slung on\n",
      "his shoulder, paid no attention to the young brakeman, as after a hurried\n",
      "glance up and down the platform, he sprang aboard and entered the coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a bound Rod was after him. \"Hello, sir!\" he cried; \"you must have\n",
      "made a mistake. This is not a passenger train.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No?\" said the other coolly, and Rod now noticed that he wore a pair of\n",
      "smoked glasses. I thought it was the \"Limited.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the 'Limited,' across the platform,\" explained Rod politely.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Certainly I am.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Oh, you do, do you. Are you its conductor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir, but I am one of its brakemen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there any more like you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, there is another like me. I sha'n't need his help though to put\n",
      "you off this train if you don't get off, and in a hurry too,\" answered Rod\n",
      "hotly, for he began to suspect that the young man was making fun of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come now!\" said the passenger mildly, \"don't get excited, I'm\n",
      "perfectly willing to go. It was a very natural mistake for a blind man to\n",
      "make. You may be blind yourself some day, and then you'll find out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know you were blind, sir,\" exclaimed Rod apologetically and\n",
      "instantly regretting his harshness toward one so cruelly afflicted. \"I am\n",
      "very sorry, and if you will allow me, I will see you safely aboard the\n",
      "'Limited.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man accepted this offer, explaining at the same time that while\n",
      "he was not totally blind, his sight was very dim. So Rod helped him off\n",
      "one train and into the other, striving by every attention to atone for\n",
      "the abruptness with which he had spoken before learning of the other's\n",
      "infirmity. As he took the stranger's hand to guide him down the steps of\n",

      "of these was at the end of the freight division where Conductor Tobin had\n",
      "been accustomed to turn over his train to a relieving crew and spend the\n",
      "day. With such a flyer as the special, however, his run was now to be\n",
      "twice as long as formerly, so that he and Rod looked forward to doing a\n",
      "hundred and fifty miles more before being relieved. There was but one\n",
      "other brakeman besides Rod, and as there was little for either of them to\n",
      "do, save to see that the rear end lights burned brightly, and always to be\n",
      "prepared for emergencies, time hung rather heavily on their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to automatic air brakes, the life of a passenger brakeman is now a\n",
      "very easy one as compared with the same life a few years ago. The\n",
      "brakeman of those days, almost as greasy and smoke begrimed as a fireman,\n",
      "spent most of his time on the swaying platforms between cars amid showers\n",
      "of cinders and clouds of blinding dust. At every call for brakes he was\n",
      "obliged to spring to the wheels of the two entrusted to his care and set\n",
      "them up by hand with the utmost exercise of his strength. He was not\n",
      "allowed to remain inside the cars between stations, and the only glimpses\n",
      "he got of their scant comfort was when he flung open their doors to call\n",
      "out the names of stations in his own undistinguishable jargon. He was\n",
      "invariably a well-grown powerfully built fellow, as rough in manner as in\n",
      "appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To-day, on all passenger trains and on many freights as well, the\n",
      "automatic brakes are operated by compressed air controlled by the\n",
      "engineman. By a single pull of a small brass lever within easy reach he\n",
      "can instantly apply every brake on his train with such force as to bring\n",
      "it to a standstill inside of a few seconds. The two small cylinders\n",
      "connected by a piston-rod on the right hand side of every locomotive just\n",
      "in front of the cab form the air-pump. It is always at work while a train\n",
      "is standing still, forcing air through lengths of rubber hose between the\n",
      "cars and into the reservoirs located beneath each one. As brakes are\n",
      "applied by the reduction of this air the engineman's lever merely opens a\n",
      "valve that allows the imprisoned force to escape with a sharp hissing\n",
      "sound. If a train should break in two the connecting lengths of rubber\n",
      "hose would be torn asunder, and the outrushing air would instantly apply\n",
      "brakes to the cars of both sections bringing them to a speedy standstill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the brakeman of to-day, instead of being the powerful, cinder-coated\n",
      "and rough-voiced fellow of a few years back, may be as slim and elegant as\n",
      "any of the passengers under his care provided he is polite, wide-awake,\n",
      "and attentive to his duty. Clad in a natty uniform, he now spends his time\n",
      "inside the car instead of on its platform. He has reports to make out,\n",
      "lamps and flags to look after, and in cases of unexpected delay must run\n",
      "back to protect his train from any other that may be approaching it.\n",
      "Formerly it was necessary to have as many brakemen on a passenger train as\n",
      "there were cars, while now it is rare to find more than two on each train.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Rod had very little to do in his new position, and soon after leaving\n",
      "the second stopping-place of his train, was sitting near the forward end\n",
      "of the coach with his head resting on the back of a seat, gazing at the\n",
      "ceiling and buried in deep thought. Conductor Tobin and the other brakeman\n",
      "were seated some distance behind him engaged in conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod was thinking of what an awful thing it was to be blind, and this chain\n",
      "of thought was suggested by a glimpse of the young man with smoked\n",
      "glasses, whom he had assisted on board the \"Limited\" some hours before,\n",
      "standing on the platform of the station they had just left. He had\n",
      "evidently reached his journey's end and was patiently waiting for some one\n",
      "to come and lead him away--or at least this was what Rod imagined the\n",
      "situation to be. In reality, that same young man, with unimpaired eyesight\n",
      "and no longer wearing smoked glasses, was on board the express special at\n",
      "that very moment. He had sprung on to the forward platform of the money\n",
      "car undetected in the darkness as the train left the circle of station\n",
      "lights and was now on its roof fastening a light rope ladder to a ledge\n",
      "just above one of the middle and half-glazed doors of the car. A red\n",
      "flannel mask concealed the lower half of his face, and as he swung\n",
      "himself down on his frail and fearfully swaying support he held a powerful\n",
      "navy revolver in his right hand. He was taking frightful risks to win a\n",
      "desperate game. Failing in his effort to conceal himself aboard the very\n",
      "train he intended to rob, he had taken passage on the \"Limited\" as far as\n",
      "its first stopping-place and had there awaited the coming of the Express\n",
      "Special. Thus far his reckless venture had succeeded, and as Rod sat in\n",
      "the coach thinking pityingly of him, he was covering the unsuspecting\n",
      "messenger in the money car with his revolver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would I do if I were blind?\" thought Rod. \"I suppose uncle would\n",
      "take care of me; but how humiliating it would be to have to go back to him\n",
      "helpless and dependent. How thankful I should be that I can see besides\n",
      "being well and strong and able to care for myself. I will do it too\n",
      "without asking help from any one, and I'll win such a name for honesty\n",
      "and faithfulness on this road that even Uncle Arms will be compelled to\n",
      "believe whatever I may tell him. I wonder if Snyder could have put that\n",
      "emery into the oil-cup himself? It doesn't seem as though any one could be\n",
      "so mean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just here a slight incident interrupted the lad's thoughts so suddenly\n",
      "that he sprang to his feet--unconsciously his eyes had been fixed on the\n",
      "bell-cord that ran through the entire train to the cab of the locomotive.\n",
      "It had hung a little slack, but all at once this slack was jerked up as\n",
      "though some one had pulled the cord. This would have been a signal to stop\n",
      "the train, and if the train were to be stopped at that point something\n",
      "must be wrong. A backward glance showed Conductor Tobin and the other\n",
      "brakeman to be still quietly engaged in conversation. Neither of them\n",
      "could have pulled the cord. Rod stepped to the door and looked out. The\n",
      "train was tearing along at a terrific speed, and the rush of air nearly\n",
      "took away his breath. There was no sign of slackening speed and everything\n",
      "appeared to be all right. The next car ahead of the coach was the money\n",
      "car. At least Conductor Tobin had thought so, though none of the trainmen\n",
      "was ever quite sure which one of the half dozen or more express cars it\n",
      "was. Its rear door was of course closed and locked, but some impulse moved\n",
      "Rod to clamber up on its platform railing and peer through the little hole\n",
      "by which the bell-cord entered. He could not see much, but that which\n",
      "was disclosed in a single glimpse almost caused his heart to cease its\n",
      "beating. Within his range of vision came the heads of two men evidently\n",
      "engaged in a struggle and one of them wore a mask over the lower part of\n",
      "his face. The next instant Rod had sprung down from his perilous perch and\n",
      "dashed back into the coach shouting breathlessly:\n",

      "The engineman, though greatly puzzled at receiving the signal to go ahead\n",

      "reach Millbank, and not to give her the \"air\" till we are well up with the\n",
      "station. It's a tough job for you, and one I hate to send you on. At the\n",
      "same time it's got to be done, and after your experience on the freight\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I don't like to leave you here alone to be shot,\" remonstrated Rod.\n",

      "There was a strong hand-clasp between the conductor and brakeman, and\n",
      "then the latter started on the perilous journey he had been ordered to\n",
      "undertake. It was no easy task to maintain a footing on the rounded roofs\n",
      "of those express cars as they were hurled on through the night at the rate\n",
      "of nearly a mile a minute; while to leap from one to another seemed almost\n",
      "suicidal. Not more than one brakeman in a thousand could have done it; but\n",
      "Rod Blake, with his light weight, athletic training, and recent experience\n",
      "combined with absolute fearlessness, was that one. His inclination was to\n",
      "get down on his hands and knees and crawl along the slippery roofs. If he\n",
      "had yielded to it he would never have accomplished the trip. He believed\n",
      "that the only way to make it was by running and clearing the spaces\n",
      "between cars with flying leaps, and, incredible as it may seem, that is\n",
      "the way he did it. He had kicked off his shoes before starting, and now\n",
      "ran with stockinged feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The occupants of the cab were as startled by his appearance beside them\n",
      "as though he had been a ghost, and when his story was told the engineman\n",
      "wanted to stop the train at once and go back to the assistance of the\n",
      "imperilled messenger. Rod however succeeded in persuading him that, as\n",
      "the messenger's fate was probably already decided, their only hope of\n",
      "capturing the robber lay in carrying out Conductor Tobin's plan of running\n",
      "at such speed that he would not dare jump from the train until a station\n",
      "prepared for his reception was reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the engineman finally agreed to this, and before he could utter\n",
      "the remonstrance that sprang to his lips, Rodman clambered back over the\n",
      "heaped-up coal of the tender, swung himself to the roof of the forward car\n",
      "and began to retrace his perilous journey to the rear end of the train. He\n",
      "argued that if Conductor Tobin's place was back there exposed to the\n",
      "shots of a desperate man, his brakeman's place was beside him. Even if Rod\n",
      "had not been a railroad boy, or \"man,\" as he now called himself, his\n",
      "natural bravery and sense of honor would have taken him back to that\n",
      "coach. Ever since he had enlisted in the service that demands as strict\n",
      "obedience as that required of a soldier and an equal contempt of danger,\n",
      "this lad was doubly alert to the call of whatever he regarded as duty.\n",
      "There is no service in the world, outside of the army, so nearly\n",
      "resembling it in requirements and discipline as that of a railroad. It is\n",

      "certain promotion and ample reward for the conscientious performance of\n",
      "every-day duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Rod, feeling in duty bound to do so, made his way back over the reeling\n",
      "roofs of that on-rushing train to the side of his superior officer. As he\n",
      "scrambled and slipped and leaped from car to car he fully realized the\n",
      "imminent peril of his situation, but was at the same time filled with a\n",
      "wild exhilaration and buoyance of spirits such as he had never before\n",
      "known.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conductor Tobin, standing just inside the coach door with pale face and\n",
      "set lips, was amazed to see him. For a moment he fancied the lad had been\n",
      "daunted by the task imposed upon him and had turned back without reaching\n",
      "the locomotive. When he realized that Rod had not only made the perilous\n",
      "trip once, but twice, his admiration was unbounded, and though he tried to\n",
      "scold him for his foolhardiness the words refused to come. He shook the\n",
      "young brakeman's hand so heartily instead that the action conveyed a\n",
      "volume of praise and appreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as they watched together with an intense eagerness for the lights of\n",

      "\n",
      "The abruptness of this unexpected stop caused the messengers in the\n",

      "dropped to the ground and ran to the door of the money car. The glare of\n",

      "\n",
      "The moment the subsiding flames rendered such a thing possible, a rush was\n",

      "him, and telling Rod to guard the door, sternly ordered the crowd to keep\n",
      "out until he had made an examination. From his post at the doorway Rod\n",
      "could look in at a sight that filled him with horror. The interior of the\n",
      "car was spattered with blood. On the floor, half hidden beneath a pile of\n",
      "packages, lay the messenger, still alive but unconscious and bleeding from\n",
      "half a dozen wounds. The brave right hand that had tried to pull the\n",
      "bell cord had been shattered by a pistol ball, and the messenger's own\n",
      "Winchester lay on the floor beside him. Broken packages that had contained\n",
      "money, jewelry, and other valuables were scattered in every direction,\n",

      "was made.\n",

      "The trainmen became furious as one after another of these mute witnesses\n",

      "next ahead of the one they were searching as though he had just left it.\n",
      "He was not noticed by the bystanders as all eyes were directed toward the\n",
      "door of the money car. To the young brakeman his figure and the stout\n",
      "leather bag that he carried seemed familiar. As he looked, the man raised\n",
      "a kid-gloved hand to shift the position of his satchel, and from it shot\n",
      "the momentary flash of a diamond. With Rod this was enough to at once\n",
      "establish the man's identity. Although he no longer wore smoked glasses\n",

      "All these thoughts darted through Rod's head like a flash of lightning,\n",
      "and as he uttered his shouts of warning he sprang to the ground with a\n",
      "vague idea of preventing the stranger's escape. At the same moment the\n",
      "crowd surged back upon him, and when he finally cleared himself from it he\n",
      "saw the man backing down the platform, holding his would-be pursuers in\n",
      "check with a levelled pistol, and just disappearing from the circle of\n",

      "\n",
      "A minute later two frightened men were driven at the point of a revolver\n",
      "from the cab of a freight locomotive that, under a full head of steam,\n",

      "hardly left it in sole charge of the robber, by whom it had already been\n",

      "plunder was disappearing before his very eyes, and if lost to view might\n",

      "whom in a struggle Rod could not have held his own for a minute, but he\n",
      "was clearly lacking in what railroad men call \"sand.\" Suddenly Rod made a\n",

      "In any struggle between two human beings, the one possessed of the more\n",

      "so much stronger than that of the fireman that the burly fellow obeyed his\n",

      "Their speed was now tremendous, for though Rod knew but little about the\n",
      "management of a locomotive engine, he did know that the wider the throttle\n",

      "he dared, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing the dark form of the\n",
      "fugitive locomotive disclosed by the glare of their own head-light. Now\n",
      "if he could keep it in sight, and so force the speed, that it would be\n",

      "them. In another instant they had dashed past it, but not before two\n",
      "pistol bullets had come crashing through the cab windows. A bit of\n",
      "splintered glass cut Rod's forehead and a little stream of blood began to\n",
      "trickle down his face. Without heeding it, he shut off steam, reversed,\n",
      "opened again, and within half a minute the pursuers were rushing back over\n",
      "the ground they had just covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the train robber tried the same game, again the two locomotives flew\n",

      "could hardly believe that he had not been hit by one of those hissing\n",
      "bullets, but as he felt no wound he again reversed his engine and again\n",
      "dashed ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they gained steadily on the fugitive. His steam was giving out, and he\n",
      "had neither the time to renew his supply nor the knowledge of how to do\n",
      "so. The pursuit was decidedly hotter than he had anticipated, and had not\n",
      "been checked in the least by his pistol shots, as he had hoped it would\n",
      "be. He must try some other plan of escape, and that quickly. He did not\n",
      "know how many men were on that fiercely pursuing locomotive, nor whether\n",
      "they were armed or not. He only knew that within another minute they would\n",
      "overtake him. He formed a desperate resolve, and a moment later Rod Blake\n",

      "they flew past. When they reached the \"dying\" locomotive of which they\n",
      "were in pursuit and found it abandoned, he knew what had taken place. The\n",
      "train robber had leaped from its cab and was now making his way across\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We must follow him!\" exclaimed Rod.\n",

      "direction he was almost certain the fugitive had taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young brakeman soon came to a wagon road running parallel to the\n",
      "railway. Here he was brought to a halt. Which way should he go? To attempt\n",
      "to continue the pursuit in either direction without some definite\n",
      "knowledge to act upon seemed foolish. If he could only discover a house at\n",
      "which to make inquiries, or if some belated traveller would only come that\n",
      "way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Belated traveller' is good,\" mused Rod as his eye caught a faint glow in\n",

      "to-day. What a wild-goose chase I have come on anyway, and what should I\n",
      "do if I overtook the robber? I'm sure I don't know. I won't give it up\n",

      "galloping horse, though it was so deadened by the sandy road that he did\n",
      "not hear it until the animal was close upon him. The light was very dim,\n",
      "and as Rod stood in a shadow neither the horse nor its rider perceived him\n",
      "until he started forward and shouted to attract the latter's attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant the startled animal had sprung to one side so suddenly as to\n",
      "fling its rider violently to the ground, where he lay motionless. The\n",
      "horse ran a short distance, then stopped and stood trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horrified at the result of his hasty action, Rod kneeled beside the\n",
      "motionless man. His head had struck the root of a tree and though the boy\n",
      "could not discover that he was seriously injured, he was unconscious. In\n",
      "vain did the distressed lad attempt to restore him. He had little idea of\n",
      "what to do, there was no water at hand, and to his ignorance it seemed as\n",
      "if the man must be dying. He lifted one of the limp hands to chafe it, and\n",
      "started with amazement at the sight of a diamond ring that had cut its way\n",
      "through the torn and blackened kid glove in which the hand was encased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could this be the very train robber of whom he was in pursuit? Where,\n",
      "then, was his leather satchel? Why, there it was, only a few feet away,\n",
      "lying where it had fallen as the man was flung to the ground. Incredible\n",
      "as it seemed, this must be the very man, and now what was to be done? Was\n",
      "ever a fellow placed in a more perplexing situation? He could not revive\n",
      "the unconscious form. Neither could he remove it from that place. Clearly\n",
      "he must have help. As he arrived at this conclusion Rod started on a run\n",

      "begun to nibble grass by the roadside, lifted his head with a snort that\n",
      "brought the lad to a sudden halt. Why not make use of this animal if he\n",
      "could catch it? Certainly his mission could be accomplished more quickly\n",
      "on horseback than on foot. He started gently toward it, holding out his\n",
      "hand and speaking soothingly; but the cautious animal tossed its head and\n",
      "began to move away. \"How much he resembles Juniper,\" thought Rod. \"Here,\n",
      "Juniper! Here June, old fellow!\" he called. At the sound of his name the\n",

      "this thought came a recollection of the pistol shots so lately fired by\n",
      "the man at his feet. Would it not be well to disarm him lest he should\n",
      "revive and again prove dangerous before assistance could be found and\n",
      "brought to the place. Rod believed it would, and, acting upon the thought,\n",

      "The road was a lonely one, and he rode more than a mile before reaching\n",
      "a farm-house. Here the excited lad rapped loudly on the front door and\n",
      "shouted. No one was yet astir, and several minutes passed before an upper\n",

      "Rod began to explain his errand; but after a few words the woman called to\n",
      "him to wait until she could come down, and then slammed the window down.\n",
      "To the young brakeman's impatience the ensuing delay seemed an hour in\n",
      "length, though in reality not more than five minutes elapsed before the\n",
      "front door opened and the woman again appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, what were you trying to tell me about men dying in the road?\" she\n",
      "asked sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Rod was about to reply there came a sound of galloping horses and a\n",
      "shout from the place where he had left Juniper fastened to a fence post.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There he is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we've got him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Throw up your hands, you scoundrel!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you dare draw a pistol or we'll fill you full of holes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These and a score of similar cries came to the ears of the bewildered lad\n",
      "as half a dozen horsemen dashed up to the front gate, and four of them,\n",
      "leaping to the ground, ran towards him while the others held the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was too astonished even to remonstrate, and as they seized him he\n",
      "submitted to the indignity as quietly as one who is dazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman in the doorway regarded this startling scene with amazement.\n",
      "When in answer to her eager questions the new-comers told her that the\n",
      "young desperado whom she had so nearly admitted to her house was a\n",
      "horse-thief, who, but a short time before, had stolen the animal now\n",
      "tied to her front fence, at the point of a revolver from the man who was\n",
      "leading him to water, she said she wouldn't have believed that such a mere\n",
      "boy could be so great a villian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the truth though,\" affirmed the man who acted as spokesman. \"Isn't\n",
      "it, Al?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, siree,\" replied Al, a heavy-looking young farm hand. \"An more 'n\n",
      "that, he fired at me too afore I'd give up the 'orse. Oh, yes, he's a bad\n",
      "un, young as he looks, an hangin' wouldn't be none too good for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did nothing of the kind!\" cried Rod, indignantly, now finding a chance\n",
      "to speak. \"This is an outrage, and----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this the fellow, Al?\" asked the spokesman, interrupting the young\n",
      "brakeman's vehement protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course it is. I'd know him anywhere by that bag slung over his\n",
      "shoulders, an he's got pistols in his pockets, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, here they are,\" replied the leader, thrusting his hands into Rod's\n",
      "coat pockets and drawing forth the two revolvers. \"Oh, there's no use\n",
      "talking, young man. The proof against you is too strong. The only thing\n",
      "for you to do is to come along quietly and make the best of the situation.\n",
      "Horse thieves have been getting altogether too plenty in this part of the\n",
      "country of late, and we've been laying for one to make an example of for\n",
      "more 'n a week now. Its mighty lucky for you that you didn't tackle an\n",
      "armed man instead of Al there, this morning. If you had you'd have got a\n",
      "bullet instead of a horse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I tell you,\" cried Rod, \"that I took those things from a man who was\n",
      "flung from that horse back here in the road about a mile. He is----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't any doubt that you took them,\" interrupted the man, grimly,\n",
      "\"the same as you took the horse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I only made use of the horse to obtain assistance for him the more\n",
      "quickly,\" continued Rod. \"I left him stunned by his fall, and he may be\n",
      "dead by this time. He will be soon, anyway, if some one doesn't go to him,\n",
      "and then you'll be murderers, that's what you'll be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us examine this bag that you admit you took from somebody without his\n",
      "permission, and see what it contains,\" said the man quietly, paying no\n",
      "heed to the lad's statement. So saying, he opened the satchel that still\n",
      "hung from Rod's shoulders. At the sight of its contents he uttered an\n",
      "exclamation of amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if this don't beat anything I ever heard of!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The others crowded eagerly about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whew! look at the greenbacks!\" cried one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And gold!\" shouted another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must have robbed a bank!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There'll be a big reward offered for this chap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a more desperate character than we thought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A regular jail-bird!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's blood on some of these bills!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He ought to be tied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This last sentiment met with such general approval that some one produced\n",
      "a bit of rope, and in another moment poor Rod's hands were securely bound\n",
      "together behind him.\n",

      "THE TRAIN ROBBER LEARNS OF ROD'S ARREST.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you the man who did it all is lying back there in the road!\"\n",
      "screamed Rod, furious with indignation at this outrage and almost sobbing\n",
      "with the bitterness of his distress. \"He is a train robber, and I'm a\n",
      "passenger brakeman on the New York and Western road. He made an escape and\n",
      "I was chasing him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just listen to that now,\" said one of the men jeeringly. \"It's more than\n",
      "likely you are the train robber yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Looks like a brakeman, doesn't he?\" sneered another, \"especially as they\n",
      "are all obliged to wear a uniform when on duty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a nice big party of men, he is. Just such a one as the railroad\n",
      "folks would collect and send in pursuit of a train robber,\" remarked the\n",
      "leader ironically. \"Oh, no, my lad, that's too thin. If you must tell\n",
      "lies I'd advise you to invent some that folks might have a living chance\n",
      "of believing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not a lie!\" declared Rod earnestly and almost calmly; for though his\n",
      "face was quite pale with suppressed excitement, he was regaining control\n",
      "of his voice. \"It's the solemn truth and I'm willing to swear to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, hush, sonny, don't swear. That would be naughty,\" remonstrated one of\n",
      "the men, mockingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without noticing him, Rod continued: \"If you will only take me back about\n",
      "a mile on the road I will show you the real train robber, and so prove\n",
      "that part of my story. Then at Millbank I can prove the rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here, young fellow,\" said the leader, harshly, \"why will you persist\n",
      "in such nonsense? We have just came over that part of the road and we\n",
      "didn't see anything of any man lying in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I dragged him to one side,\" explained Rod.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, you'll have a chance to show us your man if you can find him,\n",
      "for we are going to take you back that way anyhow. Come on, fellows, let's\n",
      "be moving. The sooner we get this young horse-thief behind bolts and bars\n",
      "the sooner we'll be rid of an awkward responsibility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So poor Rod, still bound, was placed on Juniper's back, and, with one man\n",
      "on each side of him, two in front and two behind, rode unhappily back over\n",
      "the road that he had traversed on an errand of mercy but a short time\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the little group disappeared, the woman in whose front yard this\n",
      "exciting arrest had been made turned to hasten the preparations for her\n",
      "children's breakfast that she might the sooner visit her nearest neighbors\n",
      "and tell them of these wonderful happenings. She was filled with the\n",
      "belief that she had had a most remarkable escape, and was eager to have\n",
      "her theory confirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she finally reached her neighbor's house and burst in upon them\n",
      "breathless and unannounced, she was somewhat taken aback to see a strange\n",
      "young man, wearing a pair of smoked glasses and having a very pale face,\n",
      "sitting at breakfast with them. The woman of the house informed her in a\n",
      "whisper, that he was a poor theological student making his way on foot\n",
      "back to college in order to save travelling expenses, and though he had\n",
      "only stopped to ask for a glass of water they had insisted upon his\n",
      "taking breakfast with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the visitor unburdened herself of her budget of startling news,\n",
      "ending up with: \"An' I knew he was a desp'rate character the minit I set\n",
      "eyes onto him, for I'm a master-hand at reading faces, I am. Why, sir,\"\n",
      "here she turned to the pale student by whose evident interest in her story\n",
      "she was greatly flattered, \"I could no more take him for the honest lad he\n",
      "claimed to be than I would take you for a train robber. No, indeed. A face\n",
      "is like a printed page to me every time and I'm not likely to be fooled, I\n",
      "can tell you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is truly a wonderful gift,\" murmured the young man as he rose from the\n",
      "table and started to leave the house, excusing his haste on the plea of\n",
      "having a long distance still to travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a saintly expression that young man has!\" exclaimed the visitor,\n",
      "watching him out of sight, \"and what a preacher he will make!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment he of the smoked glasses was saying to himself: \"So\n",
      "that is what happened while I lay there like a log by the roadside, is it?\n",
      "Well, it's hard luck; but certainly I ought to be able to turn the\n",
      "information furnished by that silly woman to some good account.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime poor Rod was far from enjoying a morning ride that under\n",
      "other circumstances would have proved delightful. The sun shone from an\n",
      "unclouded sky, the air was deliciously cool and bracing, and the crisp\n",
      "autumn leaves of the forest-road rustled pleasantly beneath the horses'\n",
      "feet. But the boy was thinking too intently, and his thoughts were of too\n",
      "unpleasant a nature for him to take note of these things. He was wondering\n",
      "what would happen in case the train robber should not be found where he\n",
      "had left him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not left long in suspense, for when they reached the place that he\n",
      "was certain was the right one there was no man, unconscious or otherwise,\n",
      "to be seen on either side or in any direction. He had simply regained his\n",
      "senses soon after Rod left him, staggered to his feet, and, with ever\n",
      "increasing strength, walked slowly along the road. He finally discovered\n",
      "a side path through the woods that led him to the farm-house where, on\n",
      "account of his readily concocted tale, he received and accepted a cordial\n",
      "invitation to breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Rod, his disappointment at not finding the proof of which he had\n",
      "been so confident was so great that he hardly uttered a protest, when\n",
      "instead of carrying him to Millbank or any other station on the line where\n",
      "he might have found friends, his captors turned into a cross-road from the\n",
      "left and journeyed directly away from the railroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about an hour they reached the village of Center where the young\n",
      "brakeman, escorted by half the population of the place, was conducted\n",
      "through the main street to the county jail. Here he was delivered to the\n",
      "custody of the sheriff with such an account of his terrible deeds, and\n",
      "strict injunctions as to his safe keeping, that the official locked him\n",
      "into the very strongest of all his cells. As the heavy door clanged in\n",
      "his face, and Rod realized that he was actually a prisoner, he vaguely\n",
      "wondered if railroad men often got into such scrapes while attempting the\n",
      "faithful discharge of their duties.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXVI.\n",
      "\n",
      "A WELCOME VISITOR.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To be cast into jail and locked up in a cell is not a pleasant experience\n",
      "even for one who deserves such a fate; while to an honest lad like Rodman\n",
      "Blake who had only tried to perform what he considered his duty to the\n",
      "best of his ability, it was terrible. In vain did he assure himself that\n",
      "his friends would soon discover his predicament and release him from it.\n",
      "He could not shake off the depressing influence of that narrow room, of\n",
      "the forbidding white walls, and the grim grating of the massive door. He\n",
      "was too sensible to feel any sense of disgrace in being thus wrongfully\n",
      "imprisoned; but the horror of the situation remained, and it seemed as\n",
      "though he should suffocate behind those bars if not speedily released.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime the sheriff, whose breakfast had been interrupted by the\n",
      "arrival of the self-appointed constables and their prisoner, returned to\n",
      "his own pleasant dining-room to finish that meal. He was a bachelor, and\n",
      "the only other occupant of the room was his mother, who kept house for\n",
      "him, and was one of the dearest old ladies in the world. She was a\n",
      "Quakeress, and did not at all approve of her son's occupation. As she\n",
      "could not change it, however, she made the best use of the opportunities\n",
      "for doing good afforded by his position, and many a prisoner in that jail\n",
      "found occasion to bless the sheriff's mother. She visited them all, did\n",
      "what she could for their comfort, and talked with them so earnestly, at\n",
      "the same time so kindly and with such ready sympathy, that several cases\n",
      "of complete reformation could be traced directly to her influence. Now her\n",
      "interest was quickly aroused by her son's account of the youthful prisoner\n",
      "just delivered into his keeping, and she sighed deeply over the story of\n",
      "his wickedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it certain that he did all these things, Robert?\" she asked at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I guess there is no doubt of it. He was caught almost in the very\n",
      "act,\" answered the sheriff, carelessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And thee says he is young?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, hardly more than a boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does thee think he has had any breakfast?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably not; but I'll carry him some after I've been out and fed the\n",
      "cattle,\" answered her son, who was a farmer as well as a sheriff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is thee willing I should take it to him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, if you want to, only be very careful about locking everything\n",
      "securely after you,\" replied the sheriff, who was accustomed to requests\n",
      "of this kind. \"I don't know why you should trouble yourself about him\n",
      "though, I'll feed him directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should we ever trouble ourselves, Robert, about those who are\n",
      "strangers, or sick, or in prison? Besides, perhaps the poor lad has no\n",
      "mother, while just now he must sorely feel the need of one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it happened that a few minutes later Rod Blake was startled from his\n",
      "unhappy reverie by the appearance of an old lady in a dove-colored dress,\n",
      "a snowy cap and kerchief, in front of his door. As she unlocked it and\n",
      "stepped inside, he saw that she bore in her hands a tray on which a\n",
      "substantial breakfast was neatly arranged. The lad sprang to his feet, but\n",
      "faint from hunger and exhaustion as he was, he cast only one glance at\n",
      "the tempting tray. Then he gazed earnestly into the face of his visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting the tray down on a stool, for there was no table in the cell, the\n",
      "old lady said: \"I thought thee might be hungry my poor lad, and so have\n",
      "brought thee a bit of breakfast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, madam! Don't you know me? Don't you remember me?\" cried Rod eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although startled by the boy's vehemence, the old lady adjusted her\n",
      "spectacles and regarded him carefully. \"I can't say that I do,\" she said\n",
      "at length, in a troubled tone. \"And yet thy face bears a certain look of\n",
      "familiarity. Where have I ever seen thee before?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you remember one morning a few weeks ago when you were in a\n",
      "railroad station, and dropped your purse, and I picked it up, and you gave\n",
      "me a quarter for seeing you safely on the train? Don't you? I'm sure you\n",
      "must remember.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old lady was nervously wiping her spectacles. As she again adjusted\n",
      "them and gazed keenly at the boy, a flash of recognition lighted her face\n",
      "and she exclaimed, \"Of course I do! Of course I do! Thee is that same\n",
      "honest lad who restored every cent of the money that but for thee I might\n",
      "have lost! But what does it all mean? And how came thee here in this\n",
      "terrible place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod was only too thankful to have a listener at once so interested and\n",
      "sympathetic as this one. Forgetful of his hunger and the waiting breakfast\n",
      "beside him, he at once began the relating of his adventures, from the time\n",
      "of first meeting with the dear old lady down to the present moment. It was\n",
      "a long story and was so frequently interrupted by questions that its\n",
      "telling occupied nearly an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its conclusion the old lady, who was at once smiling and tearful, bent\n",
      "over and kissed the boy on his forehead, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless thee, lad! I believe every word of thy tale, for thee has an honest\n",
      "face, and an honest tongue, as well as a brave heart. Thee has certainly\n",
      "been cruelly rewarded for doing thy duty. Never mind, thy troubles are now\n",
      "ended, for my son shall quickly summons the friends who will not only\n",
      "prove thy innocence and release thee from this place, but must reward thy\n",
      "honest bravery. First, though, thee must eat thy breakfast and I must go\n",
      "to fetch a cup of hot coffee, for this has become cold while we talked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying the old lady bustled away with a reassuring little nod and a\n",
      "cheery smile that to poor Rod was like a gleam of sunlight shining into a\n",
      "dark place. As she went, the old lady not only left his cell door unlocked\n",
      "but wide open for she had privately decided that the young prisoner should\n",
      "not be locked in again if she could prevent it.\n",
      "\n",

      "THE SHERIFF IS INTERVIEWED.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While this pleasant recognition of old acquaintances was taking place\n",
      "in the jail, the sheriff was sitting in his office and submitting to be\n",
      "interviewed by a young man who had introduced himself as a reporter from\n",
      "one of the great New York dailies. He was a pleasant young man, very\n",
      "fluent of speech, and he treated the sheriff with a flattering deference.\n",
      "He explained that while in the village on other business he had\n",
      "incidentally heard of the important arrest made that morning and thought\n",
      "that if the sheriff would kindly give him a few particulars he might\n",
      "collect material for a good story. Pleased with the idea of having his\n",
      "name appear in a New York paper the sheriff readily acceded to this\n",
      "request and gave his visitor all the information he possessed. The young\n",
      "man was so interested, and took such copious notes of everything the\n",
      "sheriff said, that the latter was finally induced to relax somewhat of his\n",
      "customary caution, and take from his safe the leather bag that had been\n",
      "captured on the person of the alleged horse-thief. The sheriff had opened\n",
      "this bag when he first received it, and had glanced at its contents, of\n",
      "which he intended to make a careful inventory at his first leisure moment.\n",
      "As this had not yet arrived, he was still ignorant of what the bag really\n",
      "contained. He knew, however, that its contents must be of great value and\n",
      "produced it to prove to the reporter that the young prisoner whom they\n",
      "were discussing was something more than a mere horse-thief.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the sheriff was still fumbling with the spring-catch of the bag,\n",
      "and before he had opened it, there came the sounds of a fall just outside\n",
      "the door, a crash of breaking china, and a cry in his mother's voice.\n",
      "Forgetful of all else, the man dropped the bag, sprang to the door, and\n",
      "disappeared in the hall beyond, leaving his visitor alone. In less than\n",
      "two minutes he returned, saying that his mother had slipped and fallen on\n",
      "the lowest step of the stairway she was descending. She had broken a cup\n",
      "and saucer, but was herself unhurt, for which he was deeply grateful. As\n",
      "the sheriff made this brief explanation, he cast a relieved glance at the\n",

      "some distance from the chair in which the young man was sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he took up the bag to open it, and again he was interrupted. This\n",
      "time the interruption came in the shape of a messenger from the telegraph\n",
      "office, bringing the startling news of the recent train robbery and the\n",
      "daring escape of its perpetrator. The sheriff first read this despatch\n",
      "through to himself, and then handed it to his visitor, who had watched his\n",
      "face with eager interest while he read it. The moment he had glanced\n",
      "through the despatch, the young man started to his feet, exclaiming that\n",
      "such an important bit of news as that would materially alter his plans.\n",
      "Then he begged the sheriff to excuse him while he ran down to the\n",
      "telegraph office, and asked his paper for permission to remain there a few\n",
      "days longer. He said that he should like nothing better than a chance to\n",
      "assist in the capture of this desperate train robber, which he had no\n",
      "doubt would be speedily effected by the sheriff. He also promised to call\n",
      "again very shortly for further information, provided his paper gave him\n",
      "permission to remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sheriff was not at all sorry to have his visitor depart, as the\n",
      "despatch just received had given new direction to his thoughts, and he was\n",
      "wondering if there could be any connection between the train robber, the\n",
      "young horse-thief, and the bag of valuables that lay unopened on his desk.\n",
      "He glanced curiously at it, and determined to make a thorough examination\n",
      "of its contents as soon as he had written and sent off several despatches\n",
      "containing his suspicions, asking for further information and requesting\n",
      "the presence at the jail of such persons as would be able to identify the\n",
      "train robber.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he finished these, his mother, who had been preparing a fresh cup of\n",
      "coffee for Rod, entered the office full of her discovery in connection\n",
      "with the young prisoner and of the startling information he had given her.\n",
      "She would have come sooner but for the presence of her son's visitor,\n",
      "before whom she did not care to divulge her news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the sheriff listened with interest to all she had to say, he\n",
      "expressed a belief that the young prisoner had taken advantage of her\n",
      "kindly nature, to work upon her sympathies with a plausible but easily\n",
      "concocted story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I tell thee, Robert, I recognize the lad as the same who helped me on\n",
      "the train the last time I went to York.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That may be, and still he may be a bad one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, with such a face! It is as honest as thine, Robert. Of that I am\n",
      "certain, and if thee will only talk with him, I am convinced thee will\n",
      "think as I do. Nor will thee relock the door that I left open?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" exclaimed the sheriff; \"you haven't left his cell-door unlocked,\n",
      "mother, after the strict charges I gave you concerning that very thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have, Robert,\" answered the old lady, calmly; \"and but for the\n",
      "others I would have left the corridor-door unlocked also. I was mindful of\n",
      "them, though, and of thy reputation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm thankful you had that much common-sense,\" muttered her son; \"and now,\n",
      "with your permission, I will take that cup of coffee, which I suppose you\n",
      "intend for your young _protegé_, up to him myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And thee'll speak gently with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes. I'll talk to him like a Dutch uncle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it happened that when the door at the end of the jail corridor was\n",
      "swung heavily back on its massive hinges, and Rod Blake, who had been\n",
      "gazing from one of the corridor windows, looked eagerly toward it, he was\n",
      "confronted by the stern face of the sheriff instead of the placidly sweet\n",
      "one of the old lady, whom he expected to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing out here, sir? Get back into your cell at once!\"\n",
      "commanded the sheriff in an angry tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, sir! please don't lock me in there again. It doesn't seem as though I\n",
      "could stand it,\" pleaded Rod.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sheriff looked searchingly at the lad. His face was certainly a very\n",
      "honest one, and to one old lady at least he had been kindly considerate.\n",
      "At the thought of the ready help extended by this lad to his own\n",
      "dearly-loved mother in the time of her perplexity, the harsh words that\n",
      "the sheriff had meditated faded from his mind, and instead of uttering\n",
      "them he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well; I will leave your cell-door open, if you will give me your\n",
      "promise not to attempt an escape.\"\n",

      "LIGHT DAWNS UPON THE SITUATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On leaving Rodman the sheriff was decidedly perplexed. His prisoner's\n",
      "honest face had made a decided impression upon him, and he had great\n",
      "confidence in his mother's judgment concerning such cases, though he was\n",
      "careful never to admit this to her. At the same time all the circumstances\n",
      "pointed so strongly to the lad's guilt that, as he reviewed them there\n",
      "hardly seemed a doubt of it. It is a peculiarity of sheriffs and jailers\n",
      "to regard a prisoner as guilty until he has been proved innocent.\n",
      "Nevertheless this sheriff gave his mother permission to visit Rod as\n",
      "often as she liked; only charging her to lock the corridor-door both upon\n",
      "entering and leaving the jail. So the dear old lady again toiled up the\n",
      "steep stairway, this time laden with books and papers. She found the tired\n",
      "lad stretched on his hard pallet and fast asleep, so she tiptoed softly\n",
      "away again without wakening him.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the young prisoner was thus forgetting his troubles, and storing up\n",
      "new strength with which to meet them, the sheriff was scouring the village\n",
      "and its vicinity for traces of any stranger who might be the train robber.\n",
      "But strangers were scarce in Center that day and the only one he could\n",
      "hear of was the reporter who had interviewed him that morning. He had gone\n",
      "directly to the telegraph office where he had sent off the despatch of\n",
      "which he had spoken, to the New York paper he claimed to represent. In it\n",
      "he had requested an answer to be sent to Millbank, and he had subsequently\n",
      "engaged a livery team with which he declared his intention of driving to\n",
      "that place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Center, though not on the New York and Western railway, was on another\n",
      "that approached the former more closely at this point than at any other.\n",
      "To facilitate an exchange of freight a short connecting link had been\n",
      "built by both roads between Center and Millbank. Over this no regular\n",
      "trains were run, but all the transfer business was conducted by specials\n",
      "controlled by operators at either end of the branch. Consequently the few\n",
      "travellers between the two places waited until a train happened along or,\n",
      "if they were in a hurry, engaged a team as the reporter had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after noon the owner of Juniper, the stolen horse, accompanied by the\n",
      "thick-headed young farm hand from whom the animal had been taken, appeared\n",
      "at the jail in answer to the sheriff's request for his presence. These\n",
      "visitors were at once taken to Rod's cell, where the young prisoner\n",
      "greatly refreshed by his nap, sat reading one of the books left by the\n",
      "dear old lady. His face lighted with a glad recognition at sight of\n",
      "Juniper's owner, and at the same moment that gentleman exclaimed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, sheriff, this can't be the horse-thief! I know this lad. That is\n",
      "I engaged him not long since to bring that very horse up here to my\n",
      "brother's place where I am now visiting. You remember me, don't you,\n",
      "young man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I do so, sir, and I am ever so glad to see some one who knew me\n",
      "before all these horrid happenings. Now if you will only make that fellow\n",
      "explain why he said I was the one who threatened to shoot him, and stole\n",
      "Juniper from him, when he knows he never set eyes on me before I was\n",
      "arrested, I shall be ever so much obliged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is this, sir?\" inquired the gentleman, turning sharply upon the young\n",
      "farm hand behind him. \"Didn't you tell me you were willing to take oath\n",
      "that the lad whom you caused to be arrested and the horse-thief were one\n",
      "and the same person?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Y-e-e-s, s-i-r,\" hesitated the thick head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you willing to swear to the same thing now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"N-n-o, your honor,--that is, not hexactly. Someway he don't look the same\n",
      "now as he did then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you don't think he is the person who took the horse from you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir, I can't rightly say as I do now, seeing as the man with the\n",
      "pistols was bigger every way than this one. If 'e 'adn't been 'e wouldn't\n",
      "got the 'orse so heasy, I can tell you, sir. Besides it was so hearly that\n",
      "the light was dim an' I didn't see 'is face good anyway. But when we\n",
      "caught him 'e 'ad the 'orse an' the bag an' the pistols.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you caught who?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The 'orse-thief. I mean this young man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you recognized him then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, I knowed 'im by the bag, an' the 'orse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you say he was a much larger man than this one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, sir! He was more 'n six foot an' as big across the shoulders as\n",
      "two of 'im.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod could not help smiling at this, as he recalled the slight figure of\n",
      "the train robber who had appropriated Juniper to his own use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is evidently a badly-mixed case of mistaken identity,\" said the\n",
      "gentleman, turning to the sheriff, \"and I most certainly shall not prefer\n",
      "any charge against this lad. Why, in connection with that same horse he\n",
      "recently performed one of the pluckiest actions I ever heard of.\" Here the\n",
      "speaker narrated the story of Rod's struggle with Juniper in utter\n",
      "darkness and within the narrow limits of a closed box-car.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its conclusion, the sheriff who was a great admirer of personal\n",
      "bravery, extended his hand to Rod, saying: \"I believe you to be the honest\n",
      "lad you claim to be, and an almighty plucky one as well. As such I want to\n",
      "shake hands with you. I must also state that as this gentleman refuses to\n",
      "enter a complaint against you I can no longer hold you prisoner. In fact I\n",
      "am somewhat doubtful whether I have done right in detaining you as long as\n",
      "I have without a warrant. Still, I want you to remain with us a few hours\n",
      "more, or until the arrival of certain parties for whom I have sent to come\n",
      "and identify the train robber.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Meaning me?\" asked Rod, with a smile. He could afford to smile now. In\n",
      "fact he was inclined to laugh and shout for joy over the favorable turn\n",
      "his fortunes appeared to be taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, meaning you,\" replied the sheriff good-humoredly. \"And to show how\n",
      "fully persuaded I am that you are the train robber, I hereby invite you to\n",
      "accompany us down-stairs in the full exercise of your freedom and become\n",
      "the honored guest of my dear mother for whom you recently performed so\n",
      "kindly a service. She told me of that at the time, and I am aware now,\n",
      "that I have not really doubted that you were what you claimed to be, since\n",
      "she recognized you as the one who then befriended her. I tell you, lad,\n",
      "it always pays in one way or another, to extend a helping hand to\n",
      "grandfathers and grandmothers, and to remember that we shall probably\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it happened that although Rod had eaten his breakfast that morning\n",
      "in a prison cell he ate his dinner in the pleasant dining-room of the\n",
      "sheriff's house with that gentleman, the dear old lady, and Juniper's\n",
      "owner, for company. It was a very happy meal, in spite of the fact that\n",
      "the real train robber was still at large, and as its conversation was\n",
      "mostly devoted to the recent occurrences in which Rod had been so\n",
      "prominent an actor, his cheeks were kept in a steady glow by the praises\n",
      "bestowed upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Directly after dinner Juniper's owner took his departure and soon\n",
      "afterwards a special train arrived from Millbank. It consisted of a\n",
      "locomotive and a single passenger coach in which were a number of New York\n",
      "and Western railroad men. They came in answer to the sheriff's request for\n",
      "witnesses who might identify the train robber. Among these new arrivals\n",
      "were Snyder Appleby who had been sent from New York by Superintendent Hill\n",
      "to investigate the affair, Conductor Tobin who, after taking the Express\n",
      "Special to the end of his run, had been ordered back to Millbank for this\n",
      "purpose, his other brakeman who had hurried ahead at the first opportunity\n",
      "from the station at which he had been left, the fireman of the locomotive\n",
      "with which Rod had chased the robber, and several others.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this party was ushered into the sheriff's private office its members\n",
      "started with amazement at the sight of Rod Blake sitting there as calmly,\n",
      "as though perfectly at home and waiting to receive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon their entrance he sprang to his feet filled with a surprise equal to\n",
      "their own, for the sheriff had not told him of their coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir! What are you doing here?\" demanded Snyder Appleby, who was the\n",
      "first to recover from his surprise, and who was filled with a sense of his\n",
      "own importance in this affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am visiting my friend, the sheriff,\" answered Rod, at once resenting\n",
      "the other's tone and air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you are! And may I ask by what right you, a mere brakeman in our\n",
      "employ, took it upon yourself to desert your post of duty, run off\n",
      "with one of our engines, endanger the traffic of the line and then\n",
      "unaccountably disappear as you did last night or rather early this\n",
      "morning?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may ask as much as you please,\" answered Rod, \"but I shall refuse to\n",
      "answer any of your questions until I know by what authority you ask them.\"\n",
      "The young brakeman spoke quietly, but the nature of his feelings was\n",
      "betrayed by the hot flush that sprang to his cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll find out before I'm through with you,\" cried Snyder savagely. \"Mr.\n",
      "Sheriff I order you to place this fellow under arrest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon what charge?\" asked the sheriff. \"Is he the train robber?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" was the reply, \"but he is a thief all the same. He is one\n",
      "of our brakemen and ran off with a locomotive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did he do with it?\" asked the sheriff, with an air of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Left it standing on the track.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I didn't know but what he carried it off with him. Did he leave it\n",
      "alone and unguarded?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Snyder was compelled to admit that the engine had been left in charge of\n",
      "its regular firemen; but still claimed that the young brakeman had\n",
      "committed a crime for which he ought to be arrested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you want me to arrest that fireman too?\" suggested the sheriff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no. It was his duty to accompany the engine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why didn't he refuse to allow it to move?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was forced to submit by threats of personal injury made by this\n",
      "brakeman fellow. Isn't that so?\" asked Snyder, and the fireman nodded an\n",
      "assent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sheriff smiled as he glanced first at the burly form of the fireman\n",
      "and then at Rod's comparatively slight figure. \"Can any of these men\n",
      "identify this alleged locomotive thief?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly they can. Tobin, tell the sheriff what you know of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Blazing with indignation at the injustice and meanness of Snyder's absurd\n",
      "charge against his favorite brakeman, Conductor Tobin answered promptly:\n",
      "\"I know him to be one of the best brakemen on the road, although he is the\n",
      "youngest. He is one of the pluckiest too and as honest as he is plucky.\n",
      "I'll own he might have made a mistake in going off with that engine; but\n",
      "all the same it was a brave thing to do and I am certain he thought he was\n",
      "on the right track.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know him too?\" asked the sheriff of the other brakeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. I am proud to say I do and in regard to what I think of him\n",
      "Conductor Tobin's words exactly express my sentiments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you also know him?\" was asked of the fireman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I know him to be the young rascal who ran me twice into such a storm\n",
      "of bullets from the train robber's pistols that it's a living wonder I'm\n",
      "not full of holes at this blessed minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else did he do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else? Why, he jumped from the engine while she was running a good\n",
      "twenty mile an hour, and started off like the blamed young lunatic he is\n",
      "to chase after the train robber afoot. Wanted me to go with him too, but I\n",
      "gave him to understand I wasn't such a fool as to go hunting any more\n",
      "interviews with them pistols. No, sir; I stuck where I belonged and if\n",
      "he'd done the same he wouldn't be in the fix he's in now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said the sheriff, quietly, \"this 'blamed young lunatic,' as you\n",
      "call him, succeeded in overtaking that train robber after all. He also\n",
      "managed to relieve him of his pistols you seem to have dreaded so greatly,\n",
      "recover the valuable property that had been stolen from the express car,\n",
      "and also a fine horse that the robber had just appropriated to his own\n",
      "use. On the whole gentleman, I don't think I'd better arrest him, do\n",

      "WHERE ARE THE DIAMONDS?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. I think he ought to be arrested,\" said Snyder Appleby in reply\n",
      "to the sheriff's question, \"and if you refuse to perform that duty I shall\n",
      "take it upon myself to arrest him in the name of the New York and Western\n",
      "Railway Company of which I am the representative here. I shall also take\n",
      "him back with me to the city where he will be dealt with according to his\n",
      "desserts by the proper authorities.\" Then turning to the members of his\n",
      "own party the self-important young secretary added: \"In the meantime I\n",
      "order you two men to guard this fellow and see that he does not escape,\n",
      "as you value your positions on the road.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't trouble yourself, Snyder, nor them either,\" said Rod\n",
      "indignantly, \"for I sha'n't require watching. I am perfectly willing to go\n",
      "to New York with you, and submit my case to the proper authorities. In\n",
      "fact I propose to do that at any rate. At the same time I want you to\n",
      "understand that I don't do this in obedience to any orders from you, nor\n",
      "will I be arrested by you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's all right,\" replied Snyder, carelessly. \"So long as we get you\n",
      "there I don't care how it is done. Now, Mr. Sheriff,\" he continued, \"we\n",
      "have already wasted too much time and if you will take us to see the bold\n",
      "train robber whom you say this boy captured single-handed and alone, we\n",
      "will finish our business here and be off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't say that he captured the train robber,\" replied the sheriff. \"I\n",
      "stated that he overtook him, relieved him of his pistols, and recovered\n",
      "the stolen property; but I am quite certain that I said nothing regarding\n",
      "the capture of the robber.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is he now?\" asked Snyder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know. This lad left him lying senseless in the road, where he had\n",

      "and prove that this lad was not he. This you have kindly done to my entire\n",
      "satisfaction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" exclaimed Snyder. \"Did you suspect Rod, I mean this brakeman, of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I must confess that I did entertain such a suspicion, and for so doing I\n",

      "At this cruel remark there arose such a general murmur of indignation, and\n",
      "the expression of Rod's face became so ominous that the speaker hastened\n",
      "to create a diversion of interest by asking the sheriff what had been done\n",
      "with the valuables recovered from the robber.\n",

      "all its contents, to the brave lad who recovered it, and entrust him with\n",
      "its safe delivery to those authorized to receive it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, the sheriff handed the bag to Rod.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snyder turned pale with rage, and snatching an unsealed letter from his\n",
      "pocket, he flung it on the table, exclaiming angrily: \"There is my\n",

      "you indicted for conspiracy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" said the sheriff, contemptuously. \"That would certainly be a\n",
      "most interesting proceeding--for you.\" Then to Rod, to whom he had already\n",
      "handed the bag, he said: \"If you decide to deliver this property to that\n",
      "young man, Mr. Blake, I would advise you to examine carefully the contents\n",
      "of the bag in presence of these witnesses and demand an itemized receipt\n",
      "for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, I will,\" replied Rod, emptying the contents of the bag on the\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a subdued exclamation from the railroad men at the sight of the\n",
      "wealth thus displayed in packages of bills and rolls of coin. Rodman\n",
      "requested the sheriff to call off the amount contained in each of these\n",
      "while he made out the list. At the same time Snyder drew from his pocket\n",
      "a similar list of the property reported to be missing from the express\n",
      "messenger's safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Rod's list was completed, Snyder, who had carefully checked off its\n",

      "the diamonds?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"The set of diamond jewelry valued at seven thousand five hundred dollars,\n",

      "Neither could poor Rod see how it was to be accomplished. For mile after\n",

      "an hour! If we were to strike a man, a cow, a wagon, or even a pile of\n",

      "gentleman, old man Newman is making things hum though! You see he has got\n",

      "hundred miles an hour just as well as not, and that he is the man to get\n",

      "in 39-1/4 seconds on her trial trip, and claims that about a month ago\n",

      "Exposition opens we shall have regular passenger trains running at that\n",

      "Reading, the New York Central and this one. Moreover, when electricity\n",
      "comes into general use as a motive power I shall expect to travel at a\n",
      "greater speed even than that. Why, they are building an electric road now\n",
      "on an air line between Chicago and St. Louis, on which they expect to make\n",

      "victims of the disaster, whose poor maimed bodies were so sadly in need of\n",
      "his soothing skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the long hours of the night, while the doctor was busy with his\n",
      "human wrecks, the gang of experienced workmen who had come by the same\n",
      "train, was rapidly clearing the wreck of cars from the tracks and putting\n",
      "them in order for a speedy resumption of traffic. The wrecking train to\n",
      "which they belonged was made up of a powerful locomotive and three cars.\n",
      "The first of these was an immensely strong and solid flat, supporting a\n",
      "small derrick, which was at the same time so powerful as to be capable of\n",
      "lifting enormous weights. Besides the derrick and its belongings the flat\n",
      "carried only a few spare car trucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next to it came a box-car, filled with timber ends for blocking, hawsers,\n",
      "chains, ropes, huge single-, double-, and treble-blocks, iron clamps, rods\n",
      "and bolts, frogs, sections of rail, heavy tarpaulins for the protection of\n",
      "valuable freight, and a multitude of other like supplies, all so neatly\n",
      "arranged as to be instantly available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last, and most interesting of all, came the tool-car, which was divided\n",
      "by partitions into three rooms. Of these, the main one was used by the\n",
      "members of the wrecking gang as a living-room, and was provided with\n",
      "bunks, a cooking-stove and utensils, and a pantry, well stocked with\n",
      "flour, coffee, tea, and canned provisions. The smaller of the two end\n",
      "rooms contained a desk, table, chairs, stationery and electrical supplies.\n",
      "It was used by the foreman of the wrecking gang, as an office in which to\n",
      "write his reports, and by the telegraph operator, who always accompanies\n",
      "a train of this description. This operator's first duty is to connect an\n",
      "instrument in his movable office with the railroad wire, which is one of\n",
      "the many strung on poles beside the track. From the temporary station thus\n",
      "established he is in constant communication with headquarters, to which he\n",
      "sends all possible information concerning the wreck, and from which he\n",
      "receives orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the tool-room at the other end of this car was kept everything that\n",
      "experience could suggest or ingenuity devise for handling and removing\n",
      "wrecked cars, freight, or locomotives. Along the sides were ranged a score\n",
      "or so of jack-screws, some of them powerful enough to lift a twenty-ton\n",
      "weight, though worked by but one man. There were also wrenches, axes,\n",
      "saws, hammers of all sizes, crowbars, torches, lanterns, drills, chisels,\n",
      "files, and, in fact, every conceivable tool that might be of use in an\n",
      "emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In less than three hours after the arrival of the wrecking train at the\n",
      "scene of the accident on the New York and Western road, the disabled\n",
      "locomotive, which had lain on its side in the ditch, had been picked up\n",
      "and replaced on the track. Such of the derailed cars as were not burned\n",
      "or crushed beyond hope of repair had also been restored to their original\n",
      "positions, scattered freight had been gathered up and reloaded, all\n",
      "inflammable _débris_ was being burned in a great heap at one side, the\n",
      "tracks were repaired, and so little remained to tell of the disaster, that\n",
      "passengers by the next day's trains looked in vain for its traces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first train to go through after the accident was Snyder Appleby's\n",
      "special. The private secretary had visited the farm-house to insist that\n",
      "Rod Blake should accompany him to New York; but he was met at the door by\n",
      "the watchful sheriff, who sternly refused to allow his sleeping charge to\n",
      "be awakened or in any way disturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't worry yourself about him,\" said the sheriff. \"He'll come\n",
      "to New York fast enough, and I'll come with him. We'll hunt the\n",
      "Superintendent's office as quick as we get there, and maybe you won't be\n",
      "so glad to see us as you think you will. That's the best I can promise\n",
      "you, for that young fellow isn't going to be disturbed before he gets good\n",
      "and ready to wake up of his own accord. Not if I can help it, and I rather\n",
      "think I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well,\" replied Snyder, who in the seclusion of his car had heard\n",
      "nothing of Rod's brave fight. \"If he is such a tender plant that his sleep\n",
      "can't be interrupted, I suppose I shall have to go on without him, for my\n",
      "time is too valuable to be wasted in waiting here any longer. But I warn\n",
      "you, sir, that if you don't produce the young man in our office at an\n",
      "early hour to-morrow morning the company will hold you personally\n",
      "responsible for the loss of those diamonds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, and ordering Conductor Tobin with the other witnesses to\n",
      "accompany him, the self-important young secretary took his departure,\n",
      "filled with anger against Rod Blake, the sheriff who had constituted\n",
      "himself the lad's champion, the wreck by which he had been delayed, and\n",
      "pretty nearly everything else that happened to cross his mind at that\n",
      "moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Rod, he slept so peacefully and soundly until long after sunrise,\n",
      "that when he awoke and gazed inquiringly about him, he was but little the\n",
      "worse for his thrilling experiences of the previous night. His first\n",
      "question after collecting his scattered thoughts was concerning the\n",
      "welfare of the man for whom he had risked so much a few hours before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The poor fellow died soon after midnight,\" replied the sheriff. \"He did\n",
      "not suffer, for he was unconscious to the last, but in spite of that he\n",
      "left you a legacy, which I believe you will consider an ample reward for\n",
      "your brave struggle to save him. At any rate, I know it is one that you\n",

      "ROD ACCEPTS THE LEGACY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sha'n't accept it,\" declared Rod. \"I couldn't take a reward for trying\n",
      "to save a man's life. You couldn't yourself, sir. You know that all the\n",
      "money in the world wouldn't have tempted you into those flames, while you\n",
      "were ready enough to go on the simple chance of saving a human being from\n",
      "an awful death. I'm sure you must feel that way, and so you know just how\n",
      "I feel about it. I only wish he could have known it too, and known how\n",
      "willingly we tried to save him. If he only had, he wouldn't have thought\n",
      "of offering us a reward. Did you find out who he was?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I found out,\" answered the sheriff, with a queer little smile. \"I\n",
      "found out, too, that he was some one whom you knew quite well and were\n",
      "deeply interested in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some one I knew!\" cried Rod, in surprise, at the same time taking a\n",
      "rapid mental note of all his railroad friends who might have been\n",
      "connected with the accident. \"Who was he? Was he a railroad man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he was not a railroad man, and I can't tell you his name, but if you\n",
      "feel strong enough, I should like to have you come and take a look at\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I do,\" replied Rod whose curiosity was now fully aroused. \"I\n",
      "feel almost as well as ever I did, excepting a little shaky, and with a\n",
      "smart here and there in the burned places.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the two entered an adjoining room, Rod's attention was instantly\n",
      "attracted by the motionless form, covered with a sheet, that lay on a bed.\n",
      "Several persons were engaged in a low-voiced conversation at one end of\n",
      "the room; but at first the lad did not notice them. He was too anxious to\n",
      "discover which of all his friends lay there so silently, to heed aught\n",
      "else just then.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he and the sheriff stepped to the side of the bed, the latter gently\n",
      "withdrew the covering and disclosed a peaceful face, from which every\n",
      "trace of grime and smoke had been tenderly removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod instantly recognized it. It was the same that he had last seen only\n",
      "the morning before lying by the forest roadside more than a hundred miles\n",
      "away. In a tone of awed amazement he exclaimed, \"the train robber!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think that settles it, gentlemen,\" said the sheriff quietly, and\n",
      "turning to the other occupants of the room who had gathered close behind\n",
      "Rod. \"We thought it must be the train robber,\" he continued, addressing\n",
      "the latter \"because we found the missing diamonds in a breast pocket of\n",
      "his coat; but we wanted your evidence to establish the fact. I have also\n",
      "recognized him as the alleged reporter who interviewed me yesterday\n",
      "morning, and who was accidentally left alone for a minute with the leather\n",
      "bag in my office. The moment I discovered that the diamonds were missing I\n",
      "suspected that he must have taken them, but thought it best to keep my\n",
      "suspicions to myself until I could trace him. I learned that a man\n",
      "answering his description had boarded the east-bound freight somewhere\n",
      "this side of Millbank and telegraphed Conductor Joe Miller to keep him in\n",
      "sight. By making use of Mr. Appleby's special I hoped to overtake and pass\n",
      "him before he reached New York. I thus expected to be on hand to welcome\n",
      "and arrest him at his journey's end, and by so doing relieve you of all\n",
      "suspicion of being anything but the honest plucky lad you have proved\n",
      "yourself. At the same time I looked forward to taking some of the conceit\n",
      "out of that young sprig of a secretary. That all my calculations were not\n",
      "upset by last night's accident was largely owing to you, for I must\n",
      "confess that, but for the shame of being outdone in bravery by a mere slip\n",
      "of a boy, I should have given up the fight to save this man long before\n",
      "the victory was won. Of course the evidence of his crime would have\n",
      "vanished with him, and we should never have known for a certainty what had\n",
      "become of the train robber or the diamonds. Some persons might even have\n",
      "continued to suspect you of being connected with their disappearance,\n",
      "while now your record is one that any man may well envy. Was I not right\n",
      "then, in saying that this poor fellow had left you a reward for your\n",
      "bravery that you will value so long as you live?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed you were,\" answered Rod, in a low tone, \"and it is a legacy that I\n",
      "can most gratefully accept, I wish he might have lived, though. It is\n",
      "terrible to think that by following him as I did I drove him to his\n",
      "death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must not think of it in that way,\" said one of the other witnesses of\n",
      "the scene, taking the lad's hand as he spoke, and at the same time\n",
      "disclosing the well-known features of Mr. Hill, the Superintendent, \"You\n",
      "must only remember that you have done your duty faithfully and splendidly.\n",
      "Although I should not have approved the course you took at the outset, the\n",
      "results fully justify all that you have done, and I am very proud to\n",
      "number you among the employees of our company. You have certainly\n",
      "graduated with honors from the ranks of brakemen, and have fairly won your\n",
      "promotion to any position that you feel competent to fill. It only rests\n",
      "with you to say what it shall be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the young man would accept a position with us,\" interrupted another\n",
      "gentleman, whom Rod knew to be a superintendent of the Express Company,\n",
      "\"we should be only too happy to offer him one, that carries with it a\n",
      "handsome salary and the promise of speedy promotion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed! You can't have him!\" exclaimed Mr. Hill. \"A railroad company\n",
      "is said to be a soulless corporation, but it has at least soul enough to\n",
      "appreciate and desire to retain such services as this lad has shown\n",
      "himself capable of rendering. He has chosen to be a railroad man, and I\n",
      "don't believe he is ready to switch off on any other line just yet. How is\n",
      "it, Blake? Have you had enough of railroading?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" replied Rod, earnestly. \"I certainly have not. I have only had\n",
      "enough of it to make me desirous of continuing in it, and if you think I\n",
      "could make a good enough fireman, I should be very glad to take Milt\n",
      "Sturgis' place on number 10, and learn to run a locomotive engine under\n",
      "Mr. Stump.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fireman!\" exclaimed Mr. Hill, in surprise. \"Is that the height of your\n",
      "ambition?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it is at present, sir,\" replied Rod, modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I thought you knew how to run an engine. It looked that way yesterday\n",
      "morning when you started off with the one belonging to the express\n",
      "special.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I did too, sir; but by that very trial I found that I knew just\n",
      "nothing at all about it. I do want to learn though, and if you haven't\n",
      "anyone else in view----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you shall have the place if you want it,\" interrupted Mr. Hill.\n",
      "\"Stump has already applied for you, and you should have had it even if all\n",
      "the events of yesterday had not happened. I must tell you though, that Joe\n",
      "Miller wants to resign his conductorship of the through freight to accept\n",
      "a position on a private car belonging to a young millionaire oil prince,\n",
      "and I was thinking of offering you his place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you ever so much, sir; but if you don't mind, I would rather run on\n",
      "number 10.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" replied the Superintendent, \"you have earned the right to do\n",
      "as you think best. Now, as the track is again clear, we will all go back\n",
      "to the city in the wrecking train, which is ready to start.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Hill entered his office an hour later his secretary handed him a\n",
      "report of his investigations in the matter of the express robbery. This\n",
      "report cast grave suspicions upon Rod Blake as having been connected with\n",
      "the affair, and advised his arrest. Snyder had spent some hours in\n",
      "preparing this document, and now awaited with entire self complaisance the\n",
      "praise which he was certain would reward his efforts. What then was his\n",
      "amazement when his superior, after glancing through the report,\n",
      "deliberately tore it into fragments, which he dropped into a waste-basket.\n",
      "At the same time he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am pleased to be able to inform you, Mr. Appleby, that the property you\n",
      "describe as missing has been recovered through the agency of this very\n",
      "Rodman Blake. I must also warn you that the company has no employee of\n",
      "whose integrity and faithfulness in the performance of duty they are more\n",
      "assured than they are of his. As you have evidently failed to discover\n",
      "this in your dealings with Mr. Blake, and as you have blundered through\n",
      "this investigation from first to last, I shall hereafter have no use for\n",
      "your services outside of routine office work.\" Thus saying, Mr. Hill\n",
      "closed the door of his private office behind him, leaving Snyder\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In regard to Rod Blake's new appointment, nothing more was said that day;\n",
      "but, sure enough, he received an order the following morning to report to\n",
      "the master mechanic for duty as fireman on engine number 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proud enough of his promotion, the lad promptly obeyed the order; and when\n",
      "that same evening he climbed into the cab of number 10, as the huge\n",
      "machine with a full head of steam on stood ready to start out with Freight\n",
      "Number 73, he felt that one of his chief ambitions was in a fair way of\n",
      "being realized. He tried to thank Truman Stump for getting him the job;\n",
      "but the old engineman only answered \"Nonsense, you won the place for\n",
      "yourself, and I'm glad enough to have such a chap as you. The only trouble\n",
      "is that you'll learn too quick, and be given an engine of your own, just\n",
      "as you are getting the hang of my ways. I won't teach you anything\n",
      "though, except how to fire properly, so you needn't expect it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That is what he said. What he did was to take every opportunity for\n",
      "showing the young fireman the different parts of the wonderful machine on\n",
      "which they rode, and of explaining them to him in the clearest possible\n",
      "manner. He encouraged him to ask questions, often allowed him to handle\n",
      "the throttle for short distances, and evidently took the greatest pride in\n",
      "the rapid progress made by his pupil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since first obtaining employment on the railroad, Rod had, according to\n",
      "his promise, written several times to his faithful friend Dan the stable\n",
      "boy on his uncle's place with requests that he would keep him informed of\n",
      "all that took place in the village. Dan sent his answers through the\n",
      "station agent at Euston, and Rod had only been a fireman a few days when\n",
      "he received a note which read as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"DEAR MR. ROD:\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"They is a man here, who I don't know, but who is asking all about\n",
      "     you. He asked me many questions, and has talk with your uncle. He\n",
      "     may mean good or he may mean bad, I don't know which. If I find out\n",
      "     ennything more I will let you know.           Yours respectful,\n",
      "\n",
      "                                                                  \"DAN.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod puzzled over this note a good deal, and wondered who on earth could be\n",
      "making inquiries about him. If he had known that it was Brown the railroad\n",
      "detective, he would have wondered still more. He finally decided that, as\n",
      "he was not conscious of having done anything wrong, he had no cause for\n",
      "worry. So he dismissed the affair, and devoted his whole attention to\n",
      "learning to be a fireman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people imagine it to be a very simple matter to shovel coal into a\n",
      "locomotive furnace, and so it is; but this is only a small part of a\n",
      "fireman's responsibility. He must know when to begin shovelling coal, and\n",
      "when to stop; when to open the blower and when to shut it off; when to\n",
      "keep the furnace door closed, and when to open it; how to regulate the\n",
      "dampers; when and how to admit water to the boiler; when to pour oil into\n",
      "the lubricating cups of the cylinder valves and a dozen other places; when\n",
      "to ring the bell, and when and how to do a multitude of other things,\n",
      "every one of which is important. He must keep a constant watch of the\n",
      "steam-gauge, and see that its pointer does not fall below a certain mark.\n",
      "The water-gauge also comes in for a share of his attention. Above all, he\n",
      "must learn, as quickly as possible, how to start, stop, and reverse the\n",
      "engine, and how to apply, or throw off the air brakes, so that he can\n",
      "readily do any of these things in an emergency, if his engineman happens\n",
      "to be absent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In acquiring all this information, and at the same time attending to his\n",
      "back-breaking work of shovelling coal, Rod found himself so fully and\n",
      "happily occupied that he could spare but few thoughts to the stranger who\n",
      "was inquiring about him in Euston. After a few days of life in the cab of\n",
      "locomotive number 10, he became so accustomed to dashing through tunnels\n",
      "amid a blackness so intense that he could not see a foot beyond the cab\n",
      "windows, to whirling around sharp curves, to rattling over slender\n",
      "trestles a hundred feet or more up in the air, and to rushing with\n",
      "undiminished speed through the darkness of storm-swept nights, when the\n",
      "head-lights seemed of little more value than a tallow candle, that he\n",
      "ceased to think of the innumerable dangers connected with his position as\n",
      "completely as though they had not existed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There came a day, however, when they were recalled to his mind in a\n",
      "startling manner. It was late in the fall, and for a week there had been\n",
      "a steady down-pour of rain that filled the streams to overflowing, and\n",
      "soaked the earth until it seemed like a vast sponge. It made busy work for\n",
      "the section gangs, who had their hands more than full with landslides,\n",
      "undermined culverts, and overflowing ditches, and it caused enginemen\n",
      "to strain their eyes along the lines of wet track, with an unusual\n",
      "carefulness. At length the week of rain ended with a storm of terrific\n",
      "violence, accompanied by crashing thunder and vivid lightnings. While this\n",
      "storm was at its height, locomotive number 10, drawing a heavy freight,\n",
      "pulled in on the siding of a station to wait for the passing of a\n",
      "passenger special, and a regular express.\n",
      "\n",
      "Truman Stump sat on his side of the cab, calmly smoking a short, black\n",
      "pipe; and his fireman stood at the other side, looking out at the storm as\n",
      "the special, consisting of a locomotive and two cars, rushed by without\n",

      "the second I would a great deal rather wait until I hear directly from my\n",

      "so long as Rodman's pride will not permit him to make the first advances\n",

      "\n",
      "They had already passed Euston, and Rod could not have left his post of\n",
      "duty then, even if they had not; but he determined to return on the very\n",

      "\n",
      "The day express had already left when the freight got in, and so he was\n",
      "obliged to wait for an excursion train that was to go out an hour later.\n",
      "It was made up of several coaches and a baggage car; but Rod did not care\n",
      "to ride in any of these. He already felt more at home on the locomotive\n",
      "than on any other part of the train, and so he swung himself into the cab,\n",
      "where he was cordially welcomed by the engineman and his assistant. They\n",
      "were glad of the chance to learn from him all the particulars of what had\n",
      "happened up the road during the great storm, and plied him with\n",
      "questions.\n",

      "not help feeling some uneasiness at the sight of Snyder Appleby sauntering\n",
      "down the platform and stepping aboard the train just as it started. He\n",
      "hoped his adopted cousin was not going to Euston. That is just where\n",
      "Snyder was going, though; and, having missed the express which he had been\n",
      "ordered to take, by his failure to be on time for it, he was obliged\n",
      "to proceed by the \"excursion extra.\" He was feeling particularly\n",
      "self-important that morning, in consequence of having been sent for on\n",
      "business by the President, and he sauntered through the train with an\n",
      "offensive air of proprietorship and authority. Not choosing to remain in\n",
      "one of the ordinary coaches, with ordinary excursionists, he walked into\n",
      "the empty baggage car, and stood looking through the window in its forward\n",
      "door. The moment he spied Rod, comfortably seated in the cab of the\n",
      "locomotive, all his old feeling of jealousy was aroused. He had applied\n",
      "to the engineman for permission to ride there a few minutes before Rod\n",
      "appeared, and it had been refused. Now to see the person whom he had most\n",
      "deeply injured, and consequently most thoroughly disliked, riding where he\n",
      "could not, was particularly galling to his pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first stop made by the train, he walked to the locomotive, and,\n",
      "in a most disagreeable tone, asked Rod if he had a written order\n",
      "permitting him to ride there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not,\" answered the young fireman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I shall consider it my duty to report both you and the engineman,\n",
      "for a violation of rule 116, which provides that no person, except those\n",
      "employed upon it, shall be permitted to ride on a locomotive without a\n",
      "written order from the proper authority,\" said Snyder, as he turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unwarranted assumption of authority made Rod furious; and, as he\n",
      "looked back and saw Snyder regarding him from the baggage car, he longed\n",
      "for an opportunity of giving the young man a piece of his mind. His\n",
      "feelings were fully shared by the other occupants of the cab. While they\n",
      "were still discussing the incident, the train plunged into a tunnel, just\n",
      "east of the Euston grade. Here, before it quite reached the other end, it\n",
      "became involved in one of the most curious and startling accidents known\n",

      "As the locomotive was beginning to emerge from the blackness of the\n",
      "tunnel, and those in its cab were just able to distinguish one another's\n",
      "faces by the rapidly increasing light from the tunnel's mouth, there came\n",
      "an awful crash and a shock like that of an earthquake. A shower of loose\n",
      "rocks fell on, and into, the cab. The locomotive was jerked backward with\n",
      "a sickening violence, and for a moment its driving wheels spun furiously\n",
      "above the track. Then it broke loose from the train, and sprang forward.\n",
      "In another moment it emerged from the tunnel, and was brought to a\n",
      "standstill, like some panting, frightened animal, a few yards beyond its\n",
      "mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The occupants of the cab, bruised and shaken, stared at each other with\n",
      "blanched, awe-stricken faces. They had seen the train behind them\n",
      "swallowed by a vast tumbling mass of rock, and believed themselves the\n",
      "only survivors of one of the most hideous of railroad disasters. Only\n",
      "Rod thought he had seen the end of the baggage car protruding from the\n",
      "crushing mass, just as the locomotive became released and sprang forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The tunnel roof has caved in,\" said the engineman with a tone of horror;\n",
      "\"and not a soul can have escaped beside ourselves. All those hundreds of\n",
      "people are lying in there, crushed beyond recognition. Oh, it is terrible!\n",
      "terrible!\" and tears, expressive of the agony of his mind, coursed down\n",
      "the strong man's cheeks. Partially recovering himself in a moment, he\n",
      "said, \"There is nothing left for us to do but go on to Euston, report what\n",
      "has happened, and stop all trains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod Blake agreed that this was the engineman's first duty; but declared\n",
      "his intention of staying behind, and of going back into the tunnel, to see\n",
      "if there was not some one who might yet be saved. In vain they urged him\n",
      "not to, and pointed out the danger as well as the hopelessness of the\n",
      "attempt. He was certain that the end of the baggage car could be reached,\n",
      "and remembered the figure he had seen standing in it, as they entered the\n",
      "tunnel. He felt no trace of resentment against Snyder Appleby now; only a\n",
      "great overwhelming pity, coupled with the conviction that he was still\n",
      "within reach of help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally they left him; and, armed with an axe from the tender, the young\n",
      "fireman again entered the dreadful darkness. Loose stones were still\n",
      "falling from the roof of the tunnel, and more than one of these struck and\n",
      "painfully bruised him. The air was stifling with clouds of dust and smoke.\n",
      "Only the lad's dauntless will and splendid courage enabled him to keep on.\n",
      "All at once the splintered end of a car assumed shape in the obscurity\n",
      "ahead of him. He heard a slow rending of wood, as one after another of its\n",
      "stout timbers gave way, and then, above all other sounds, came an agonized\n",
      "human cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Rod cut his way into that car, how he found and dragged out Snyder\n",
      "Appleby's mangled form, or how he managed to bear its helpless weight to\n",
      "the open air and lay it on the ground beside the track, he never knew. He\n",
      "only knew, after it had been done, that he had accomplished all this\n",
      "somehow, and that he was weak and faint from his exertions. He also knew\n",
      "that he had barely escaped from the baggage car with his precious burden,\n",
      "when it was wholly crushed, and buried beneath the weight of rock from\n",
      "above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snyder had been conscious, and had spoken to him when he found him,\n",
      "pinned to the side of the car by its shattered timbers; but now he lay\n",
      "insensible, and apparently lifeless. Rod dashed water in his face, and in\n",
      "a few minutes had the satisfaction of seeing a faint color flush the\n",
      "pallid cheeks. Then the closed eyes opened once more, and gazed into the\n",
      "young fireman's face. The lips moved, and Rod bent his head to catch the\n",
      "faint sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The cup is fairly yours, Rod; for I put the emery in my wheel myself. Can\n",
      "you forgive--\" was what he heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rodman's eyes were filled with tears as he answered, \"Of course I forgive\n",
      "you, fully and freely, old man. But don't worry about that now. Keep quiet\n",
      "and don't try to talk. We'll soon have you at home, where you'll be all\n",
      "right, and get over this shake-up in no time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright smile passed over Snyder's face, and glorified it. Then his eyes\n",
      "closed wearily, never again to be opened in this world. When help came,\n",
      "and the poor, torn body was tenderly lifted, its spirit had fled. His\n",
      "faults had found forgiveness, here, from the one whom he had most deeply\n",
      "injured. Is there any doubt but what he also found it in the home to which\n",
      "he had gone so peacefully, and with so happy a smile lighting his face?\n",
      "\n",
      "Strange as it may seem, Snyder Appleby was the only victim of this curious\n",
      "accident; for the entire mass of falling material in the tunnel descended\n",
      "on the baggage car, of which he was the sole occupant. The hundreds of\n",
      "excursionists in the coaches were badly shaken up, and greatly frightened\n",
      "by the sudden stopping of the train; but not one was seriously injured.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Vanderveer first heard of the accident at Major Appleby's house,\n",
      "where he was engaged in an earnest conversation with that gentleman, about\n",
      "his nephew and his adopted son. While they were still talking, a carriage\n",
      "drove to the door, bearing Rod Blake and the lifeless form of him whom the\n",
      "young fireman had risked his life to save.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the Major had listened to the story of the lad who brought to him at\n",
      "the same time joy and grief, the tears streamed down his furrowed cheeks,\n",
      "and he exclaimed, \"My boy! my dear boy! the pride and hope of my old age!\n",
      "Forgive me as you have forgiven him, and never leave me again.\"\n",

      "\"I never will, Uncle,\" was the answer.\n",

      "of the Steel Wheel Club's railroad cup, in Parma violets, with the\n",
      "inscription, woven of white violets, \"Forgive us our Trespasses.\" Directly\n",
      "behind the coffin, the members of the club marched in a body, headed by\n",
      "their captain, Rod Blake, whose resignation had never been accepted.\n",

      "As for the young captain's future, the events on which this story is\n",

      "That he will become a prominent railroad man, in some one of the many\n",
      "lines now opening before him, is almost certain. He finished his\n",
      "apprenticeship with Truman Stump, on locomotive number 10, and became so\n",
      "fully competent to act as engineman himself, that the master mechanic\n",
      "offered him the position. At the same time President Vanderveer invited\n",
      "him to become his private secretary, which place Rod accepted, as it\n",
      "seemed to him the best school in which to study the higher branches of\n",
      "railroad management. He is still one of the most popular fellows on the\n",
      "road, and his popularity extends to every branch of the company's service.\n",
      "Even Smiler, the railroad dog, will leave his beloved trains for days at a\n",
      "time, to sit in the President's office, and mount guard over the desk of\n",
      "the private secretary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long ago, when the chief officer of the road was asked to explain the\n",
      "secret of Rod Blake's universal popularity, he replied: \"I'm sure I don't\n",
