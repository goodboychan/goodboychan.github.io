    "- Problems that could occur in data science aren't always easily detectable; you might have values being encoded incorrectly, features being used inappropriately, unexpected data breaking assumptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to test our functions in a way that is repeatable and automated. Ideally, we'd run a test program that runs all our unit tests and cleanly lets us know which ones failed and which ones succeeded. Fortunately, there are great tools available in Python that we can use to create effective unit tests!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit Test Advantages and Disadvantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of unit tests is that they are isolated from the rest of your program, and thus, no dependencies are involved. They don't require access to databases, APIs, or other external sources of information. However, passing unit tests isn’t always enough to prove that our program is working successfully. To show that all the parts of our program work with each other properly, communicating and transferring data between them correctly, we use integration tests. In this lesson, we'll focus on unit tests; however, when you start building larger programs, you will want to use integration tests as well.\n",

    "### Tips for Conducting a Code Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what we are looking for, let's go over some tips on how to actually write your code review. When your coworker finishes up some code that they want to merge to the team's code base, they might send it to you for review. You provide feedback and suggestions, and then they may make changes and send it back to you. When you are happy with the code, you approve and it gets merged to the team's code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, with code reviews you are now dealing with people, not just computers. So it's important to be thoughtful of their ideas and efforts. You are in a team and there will be differences in preferences. The goal of code review isn't to make all code follow your personal preferences, but a standard of quality for the whole team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip: Use a code linter**\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't really a tip for code review, but can save you lots of time from code review! Using a Python code linter like [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) can automatically check for coding standards and PEP 8 guidelines for you! It's also a good idea to agree on a style guide as a team to handle disagreements on code style, whether that's an existing style guide or one you create together incrementally as a team. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip: Explain issues and make suggestions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than commanding people to change their code a specific way because it's better, it will go a long way to explain to them the consequences of the current code and suggest changes to improve it. They will be much more receptive to your feedback if they understand your thought process and are accepting recommendations, rather than following commands. They also may have done it a certain way intentionally, and framing it as a suggestion promotes a constructive discussion, rather than opposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "BAD: Make model evaluation code its own module - too repetitive.\n",

    "BETTER: Make the model evaluation code its own module. This will simplify models.py to be less repetitive and focus primarily on building models.\n",

    "GOOD: How about we consider making the model evaluation code its own module? This would simplify models.py to only include code for building models. Organizing these evaluations methods into separate functions would also allow us to reuse them with different models without repeating code.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip: Keep your comments objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to avoid using the words \"I\" and \"you\" in your comments. You want to avoid comments that sound personal to bring the attention of the review to the code and not to themselves.\n",

    "\n",

    "**Tip: Provide code examples**\n",

    "When providing a code review, you can save the author time and make it easy for them to act on your feedback by writing out your code suggestions. This shows you are willing to spend some extra time to review their code and help them out. It can also just be much quicker for you to demonstrate concepts through code rather than explanations.\n",
